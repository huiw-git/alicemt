# Set Up  a Data Science Client
  After you have configured an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by installing **R Services (In-Database)**, you'll want to set up an R development environment that is capable of connecting to the server for remote execution and deployment. The client should include Microsoft R Open, as well as the additional RevoScaleR packages that support distributed execution of R on SQL Server.  
  
 You can do this by installing [Microsoft R Client](http://aka.ms/rclient/download).
 
 For more information about using Microsoft R Client to connect to SQL Server using the ScaleR packages, see  [ScaleR Getting Started](https://msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft-r/scaler-getting-started#).  
 
  
 For a detailed walkthrough of how to connect to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] instance for remote execution of R code, see this tutorial: [Data Science Deep Dive: Using the RevoScaleR Packages](../Topic/Data%20Science%20Deep%20Dive:%20Using%20the%20RevoScaleR%20Packages.md).
