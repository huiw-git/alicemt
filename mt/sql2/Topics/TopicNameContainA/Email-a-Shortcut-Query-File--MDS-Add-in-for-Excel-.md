# Email a Shortcut Query File (MDS Add-in for Excel)
  In the [!INCLUDE[ssMDSshort](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSshort_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSXLS_md.md)], email a shortcut query file to someone when you want to ensure theyâ€™re working with the same data that you are. You should share queries rather than saving the worksheet and emailing it.  
  
## Prerequisites  
 To perform this procedure:  
  
-   You must have Outlook 2010 or later installed.  
  
-   You must have MDS-managed data in an active worksheet in Excel.  
  
### To send a shortcut query file  
  
1.  Ensure that the data in the worksheet is in the format you want to share. For more information about filtering data and reordering columns, see [Filter Data before Exporting &#40;MDS Add-in for Excel&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Filter-Data-before-Exporting--MDS-Add-in-for-Excel-.md) and [Reorder Columns &#40;MDS Add-in for Excel&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Reorder-Columns--MDS-Add-in-for-Excel-.md).  
  
2.  In the **Save and Send** group, click **Send Query**. An email message opens and the shortcut query file is attached.  
  
## Next Steps  
  
-   To open the shortcut query file, the recipient of the email must have the MDS [!INCLUDE[ssMDSXLS](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssMDSXLS_md.md)] installed. The recipient can double-click the file to open it.
