If you are upgrading your server infrastructure from a previous version of Configuration Manager \(such as Configuration Manager 2007 or System Center 2012 Configuration Manager\), we recommend that you complete the server upgrades including installing all current branch updates, before upgrading the Configuration Manager clients.   The latest current branch update contains the latest version of the client, so it's best to do client upgrades after you have installed all of the Configuration Manager updates you want to use.
