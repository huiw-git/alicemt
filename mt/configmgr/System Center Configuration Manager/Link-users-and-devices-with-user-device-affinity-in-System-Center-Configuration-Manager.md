# Link users and devices with user device affinity in System Center Configuration Manager
User device affinity in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] associates a user with one or more devices. This can eliminate the need to know the names of a user’s devices in order to deploy an application to that user. Instead of deploying the application to each of the user’s devices, you deploy the application to the user. Then, user device affinity automatically ensures that the application installs on all devices that are associated with that user.  
  
 You can define primary devices that are typically the devices that users use on a daily basis to perform their work. When you create an affinity between a user and a device, you gain more app deployment options. For example, if a user requires Microsoft Office Visio, you can install it on the user’s primary device by using a Windows Installer deployment. However, on a device that is not a primary device, you might deploy Microsoft Office Visio as a virtual application. You can also use user device affinity to predeploy software on a user’s device when they are not logged in so that when the user logs on, the app is already installed and ready to run.  
  
 You must manage user device affinity information for computers. User device affinities are automatically managed by [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] for the mobile devices that it enrolls.  
  
## Manually configure user device affinity  
  
#### To configure primary users for a device  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Assets and Compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, click **Devices**.  
  
3.  Select a device from the list. Then, in the **Home** tab, in the **Device** group, click **Edit Primary Users**.  
  
4.  In the **Edit Primary Users** dialog box, search for and select the users to add as primary users for the selected device, and then click **Add**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The **Primary Users** list shows users who are already primary users of this device and the method by which each user-device relationship was assigned.  
  
#### To configure primary devices for a user  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Assets and Compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, click **Users**.  
  
3.  Select a user from the list. Then, in the **Device** tab, click **Edit Primary Devices**.  
  
4.  In the **Edit Primary Devices** dialog box, search for and select the devices to add as primary devices for the selected user, and then click **Add**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The **Primary Devices** list shows devices that are already configured as primary devices for this user and the method by which each user-device relationship was assigned.  
  
## Automatically create user device affinities (Windows PCs only)  
 [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] reads data about user logons from the Windows Event log. To be able to automatically create user device affinities, you must enable the following two settings from the local security policy on client computers to store logon events in the Windows Event log.  
  
-   **Audit account logon events**  
  
-   **Audit logon events**  
  
 You can use Windows Group Policy to configure these settings.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If an error causes the Windows Event log to generate a high number of entries, this can result in a new event log being created. If this occurs, existing logon events might be no longer be available to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
>   
>  Be careful implementing the **Audit account logon events** and **Audit logon events** in Windows XP. By default the retention policy is 7 days and it is very likely that these events will fill up the Security Event Log. Standard users will not be able to logon if the event log is full. To prevent the issue, also set the policy **Retention Method** for the security log to **Overwrite events as needed**. To allow sufficient data for user device affinity, also set the policy Maximum security log size to a reasonable value such as 5-20 MB.  
  
#### To configure the site to automatically create user device affinities  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Administration**.  
  
2.  In the **Administration** workspace, click **Client Settings**.  
  
3.  To modify the default client settings, select **Default Client Settings**, and then, in the **Home** tab, in the **Properties** group, click **Properties**. To create custom client agent settings, select the **Client Settings** node, and then, in the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Custom Client Device Settings**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you modify the default client settings, they will be deployed to all computers in the hierarchy. For more information about configuring client settings, see [How to configure client settings in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-configure-client-settings-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
4.  For the client setting **User and Device Affinity**, configure the following:  
  
    -   **User device affinity threshold (minutes)** - Specify the number of minutes of usage before a user device affinity is created.  
  
    -   **User device affinity threshold (days)** – Specify the number of days over which the usage based affinity threshold is measured.  
  
    -   **Automatically configure user device affinity from usage data** – From the drop-down list, select **True** to enable the site to automatically create user device affinities. If you select **False**, then you must approve all user device affinity assignments.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  **Example:** if **User device affinity threshold (minutes)** is specified as **60** minutes and **User device affinity threshold (days)** is specified at **5** days, the user must use the device for at least 60 minutes over a period of 5 days to automatically create a user device affinity.  
    >   
    >  After an automatic user device affinity is created, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] continues to monitor the user device affinity thresholds. If the user’s activity for the device falls below the configured thresholds, then the user device affinity will be removed. Configure **User device affinity threshold (days)** to a value of at least **7** days to avoid situations where an automatically configured user device affinity might be lost while the user is not logged on, for example, during the weekend.  
  
## Import user device affinities from a file  
 You can import a file that contains user device affinities to enable you to create many relationships at one time. For this procedure, the subject devices must have been discovered and exist as resources in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] database, otherwise this procedure will fail.  
  
#### To import a file containing user device affinities  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Assets and Compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, click either **Users** or **Devices**.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Import User Device Affinity**.  
  
4.  On the **Choose Mapping** page of the **Import User Device Affinity Wizard**, specify the following information:  
  
    -   **File name** – Specify a comma-separated values (.csv) file that contains a list of users and devices between which you want to create an affinity. In this file, each user-and-device pair must be on a separate line separated by a comma. Use the format *<Domain\>\\<user name\>*,*<device NetBIOS name\>*.  
  
    -   **This file has column headings for reference purposes** – If the comma-separated values file has a top-row header line, select this option and the header line will be ignored during the import.  
  
5.  If the file you are importing contains more than two items on each line, you can use **Column** and **Assign** to specify which columns represent users and devices and which columns to ignore during import.  
  
6.  Click **Next** and then complete the **Import User Device Affinity Wizard**.  
  
## Allow users to create a user device affinity  
 Use these procedures to let users to create their own user device affinity from Software Center.  
  
#### To configure the site to allow user created user device affinity requests  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Administration**.  
  
2.  In the **Administration** workspace, click **Client Settings**.  
  
3.  To modify the default client settings, select **Default Client Settings**, and then, in the **Home** tab, in the **Properties** group, click **Properties**. To create custom client agent settings, select the **Client Settings** node, and then, in the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Custom Client User Settings**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you modify the default client settings, they will be deployed to all computers in the hierarchy. For more information about configuring client settings, see [How to configure client settings in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-configure-client-settings-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
4.  Select the client setting **User and Device Affinity** and then, in the **Allow user to define their primary devices** drop-down list, select **True**.  
  
#### To configure a user device affinity  
  
1.  In the Application Catalog, click **My Systems**.  
  
2.  Enable the option **I regularly use this computer to do my work**.  
  
## Manage user device affinity requests from users  
 When the client setting **Automatically configure user device affinity from usage data** is set to **False**, you must approve all user device affinity assignments.  
  
#### To approve or reject a user device affinity request  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Assets and Compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select the user or device collection for which you want to manage affinity requests.  
  
3.  In the **Home** tab, in the **Collection** group, click **Manage Affinity Requests**.  
  
4.  In the **Manage User Device Affinity Requests** dialog box, select an affinity request, then click **Approve** or **Reject**.
