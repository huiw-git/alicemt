# Setup Downloader for System Center Configuration Manager
Before you run Setup to install or upgrade a [!INCLUDE[cm6long_md](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] site, you can use this stand-alone application (**Setupdl.exe**) from the version of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] that you want to install to download updated Setup files that are required by Setup.  
  
 The use of updated setup files ensure your site installation uses current versions of key installation files:  
  
-   When you use Setup Downloader to download files prior to starting setup, you specify a folder to contain the files.  
  
-   The account you use to run Setup Downloader must have **Full Control** permissions to the download folder.  
  
-   When you run Setup to install or upgrade a site, you can direct it to use this local copy of files you previously downloaded. This prevents Setup form having to connect to Microsoft when you start the site install or upgrade.  
  
-   You can use the same local copy of setup files for subsequent site installations or upgrades.  
  
 The following types of files are downloaded by Setup Downloader:  
  
-   Required prerequisite redistributable files  
  
-   Language packs  
  
-   The latest product updates for Setup  
  
 There are two options to run Setup Downloader:  
  
## Run Setup Downloader with the user interface  
  
1.  On a computer that has Internet access, open Windows Explorer, and browse to **<ConfigMgrInstallationMedia\>\SMSSETUP\BIN\X64**  
  
2.  Double-click **Setupdl.exe**. The Setup Downloader opens.  
  
3.  Specify the path for the folder that will host the updated installation files, and then click **Download**. Setup Downloader verifies the files that are currently in the download folder and downloads only the files that are missing or are newer than the existing files. Setup Downloader creates subfolders for the downloaded languages. Setup Downloader will create the folder if it does not exist.  
  
4.  View the **ConfigMgrSetup.log** file in the root of the drive C to review the download results.  
  
## Run Setup Downloader from a command prompt  
  
1.  Open a Command Prompt window and browse to **<ConfigMgrInstallationMedia\>\SMSSETUP\BIN\X64**  
  
2.  Run  **setupdl.exe** to open Setup Downloader. Optionally, you can use the following command-line options with setupdl.exe:  
  
    -   **/VERIFY**: Use this option to verify the files in the download folder, which include language files. Review the ConfigMgrSetup.log file in the root of the drive C for a list of files that are outdated. No files are downloaded when you use this option.  
  
    -   **/VERIFYLANG**: Use this option to verify the language files in the download folder. Review the ConfigMgrSetup.log file in the root of the drive C for a list of language files that are outdated/  
  
    -   **/LANG**: Use this option to download only the language files to the download folder.  
  
    -   **/NOUI**: Use this option to start Setup Downloader without displaying the user interface. When you use this option, you must specify the **download path** as part of the command line.  
  
    -   **<DownloadPath\>**: You can specify the path to the download folder to automatically start the verification or download process. You must specify the download path when you use the **/NOUI** option. When you do not specify a download path, you must specify the path when Setup Downloader opens. Setup Downloader will create the folder if it does not exist.  
  
     Usage examples:  
  
    -   **setupd <DownloadPath\>**  
  
        -   Setup Downloader starts, verifies the files in the specified download folder, and downloads only the files that are missing or are newer than the existing files  
  
    -   **setupdl /VERIFY <DownloadPath\>**  
  
        -   Setup Downloader starts and verifies the files in the specified download folder  
  
    -   **setupdl /NOUI <DownloadPath\>**  
  
        -   Setup Downloader starts, verifies the files in the specified download folder, and downloads only the files that are missing or are newer than the existing files  
  
    -   **setupdl /LANG  <DownloadPath\>**  
  
        -   Setup Downloader starts, verifies the language files in the specified download folder, and downloads only the language files that are missing or are newer than the existing files  
  
    -   **setupdl /VERIFY**  
  
    -   Setup Downloader starts, and then you must specify the path to the download folder. Next, after you click Verify, Setup Downloader verifies the files in the download folder  
  
3.  View the **ConfigMgrSetup.log** file in the root of the drive C to review the download results
