# Introduction to remote control in System Center Configuration Manager
Use remote control in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] to remotely administer, provide assistance, or view any client computer in the hierarchy. You can use remote control to troubleshoot hardware and software configuration problems on client computers and to provide help desk support when access to the userâ€™s computer is required. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] supports the remote control of workgroup computers and computers that are joined to an Active Directory domain.  
  
 In addition, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] lets you configure client settings to run Windows Remote Desktop and Remote Assistance from the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot establish a Remote Assistance session from the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console to a client computer in the following scenarios:  
>   
>  -   The client computer is in a workgroup.  
> -   The computer running the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console is running Windows XP Service Pack 3, but the host computer is not running Windows XP Service Pack 3. For more information, see your Windows Remote Assistance documentation.  
  
 You can start a remote control session from any device collection in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, from the Windows Command Prompt window, or from the Windows **Start** menu.
