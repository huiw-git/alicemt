# Task sequence variables in System Center Configuration Manager
This section contains reference information about action variables and built-in variables that can be used in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] task sequences. Task sequence action variables provide a mechanism to configure and customize individual task sequence steps within a task sequence. Task sequence built-in variables supply configuration settings for computer, operating system, and user state configuration tasks that are performed on the destination computer. For more information about task sequence variables, see [Planning considerations for automating tasks in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Planning-considerations-for-automating-tasks-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).
