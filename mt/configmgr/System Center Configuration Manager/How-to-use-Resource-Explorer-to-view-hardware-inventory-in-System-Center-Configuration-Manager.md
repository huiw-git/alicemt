# How to use Resource Explorer to view hardware inventory in System Center Configuration Manager
Use Resource Explorer in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] to view information about hardware inventory that has been collected from clients in your hierarchy.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Resource Explorer will not display any inventory data until a hardware inventory cycle has run on the client you are connecting to.  
  
 Resource Explorer in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] contains the following sections related to hardware inventory:  
  
-   **Hardware** - Contains the most recent hardware inventory collected from the specified [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client device. You can review the inventory item **Workstation Status** to discover the time and date when the device last performed a hardware inventory.  
  
-   **Hardware History** â€“ Contains a history of inventoried items that have changed since the last hardware inventory was performed. Each item in the list contains a **Current** node and one or more *<date\>* nodes. You can compare the information in the current node to one of the historical nodes to discover items that have changed in the client computers hardware inventory.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] retains hardware inventory history for the number of days you specify in the **Delete Aged Inventory History** site maintenance task  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For information about how to view hardware inventory from clients that run Linux and UNIX, see [How to monitor clients for Linux and UNIX servers in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-monitor-clients-for-Linux-and-UNIX-servers-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
### How to run Resource Explorer from the Configuration Manager console  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Assets and Compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, click **Devices** or open any collection that displays devices.  
  
3.  Click the computer containing the inventory that you want to view and then, in the **Home** tab, in the **Devices** group, click **Start** and then click **Resource Explorer**. The **Resource Explorer** window will open.  
  
4.  You can right-click any item in the right-pane of the **Resource Explorer** window and then click **Properties** to open the *<item name\>***Properties** dialog box which can help you to view the collected inventory information in a more readable format.  
  
5.  When you are finished, close the **Resource Explorer** window.
