# System Center Configuration Manager privacy statement - Mobile device addendum
This privacy statement should be read in conjunction with the [System Center Configuration Manager privacy statement](../System Center Configuration Manager/System-Center-Configuration-Manager-privacy-statement.md) and the [Microsoft Intune Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=265368). Provisions in those documents are applicable. This privacy statement covers the features for Enterprise Enrollment related to mobile device management in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)]. This disclosure focuses on the high-level aspects of the enrollment feature, and is not intended to be an exhaustive list.  
  
## **Enterprise Enrollment for Mobile Devices**  
 Enterprise Enrollment allows you to enroll your device with a [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] server. After your phone is enrolled, your company’s IT department can install software, configure settings, and view a list of all installed software on your phone. Your IT department also has the ability to reset your device to the manufacturer’s defaults wiping all personal settings and data.  
  
### Information Collected, Processed, or Transmitted:  
 Enterprise Enrollment will send your email address to your corporate [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] server. Enterprise Enrollment will also install a digital certificate from the corporate certification authority. Please note that no information is sent to or collected by Microsoft.  
  
### Choice/Control:  
 It is your choice to use Enterprise Enrollment; during enrollment you can stop the process at any time before you enter your password and agree to continue with the process. After that you remain enrolled until you reset your device back to the manufacturer's defaults. If your device becomes unenrolled by your corporate administrator, your device may be wiped of all personal settings and data and be reset back to the manufacturer’s defaults.
