# Site and site system prerequisites for System Center Configuration Manager

 Windows computers require specific configurations to support use as a [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] site system server.  
  
 
 For some products, like Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) for the software update point, you will need to refer to that products documentation to identify additional prerequisites and limitations for use of that product. Only configurations that direclty apply to use with [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] are included here.   
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On January 12th of 2016, support for .NET 4.0, 4.5, and 4.5.1 expires. For more information see [Microsoft .NET Framework Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/framework_faq?WT.mc_id=azurebg_email_Trans_943_NET452_Update) at support.microsoft.com.  
  
## <a name="bkmk_generalprerewq"></a> General site server requierments and limitations:
**The following apply to all site system servers:**
  
-   Each site system server must use a 64-bit operating system. The only exception to this is the distribution point site system role which can be installed on some 32-bit operating systems.  
  
-   Site systems are not supported on Server Core installations of any operating system. An exception to this are that Server Core installations are supported for distribution point site system role, without PXE or multicast support.  
  
-   After a site system server is installed, it is not supported to change:  
  
    -   The domain name of the domain where the site system computer is located (also called a **domain rename**)  
  
    -   The domain membership of the computer  
  
    -   The name of the computer  
  
     If you must change any of these, you must first remove the site system role from the computer and then reinstall the role after the change is complete. If this affects the site server computer, you must uninstall the site and then reinstall the site after the change is complete.  
  
-   Site system roles are not supported on an instance of a Windows Server cluster. The only exception to this is the site database server.  
  
-   It is not supported to change the startup type or Log on as settings for any [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] service. Doing so can prevent key services from running correctly.

-   The version that is installed depends on the computers platform (x86 or x64).  
  
 **Microsoft Azure:**  
  
-   You can use a cloud service in Microsoft Azure to host a distribution point.  
  
 **To support PXE or multicast:**  
  
-   Install and configure the Windows Deployment Services (WDS) Windows role  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  WDS installs and configures automatically when you configure a distribution point to support PXE or Multicast on a server that runs Windows Server 2012 or later.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The distribution point site system role does not require Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS). When BITS is configured on the distribution point computer, BITS on the distribution point computer is not used to facilitate the download of content by clients that use BITS.  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_2008EPPpreq"></a> Endpoint Protection point  
 **.NET Framework:**  
  
-   .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 (or later)  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_2008Enrollpreq"></a> Enrollment point  
 **.NET Framework:**  
  
-   4.5.2  
  
     When this site system role installs, if the server does not already have a supported version of .NET Framework installed, Configuration Manager automatically installs .NET Framework 4.5.2. This installation can place the server into a reboot pending state. When a reboot is pending for .NET Framework, .NET applications might fail until after the server reboots and the installation completes.  
  
 **Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) activation:**  
  
-   HTTP Activation  
  
-   Non-HTTP Activation  
  
 **IIS configuration:** Requires the default IIS configuration with the following additions:  
  
-   Application Development:  
  
    -   ASP.NET (and automatically selected options)  
  
         In some scenarios, such as when IIS is installed or reconfigured after the .NET Framework version 4.5.2 is installed, you must explicitly enable ASP.NET version 4.5. For example, on a 64-bit computer that runs the .NET Framework version 4.0.30319, run the following command: **%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\aspnet_regiis.exe -i -enable**  
  
 **Computer memory:**  
  
-   The computer that hosts this site system role must have a minimum of 5% of the computers available memory free to enable the site system role to process requests.  
  
-   When this site system role is co-located with another site system role that has this same requirement, this memory requirement for the computer does not increase, but remains at a minimum of 5%.
