# Health attestation for System Center Configuration Manager
Administrators can view the status of [Windows 10 Device Health Attestation](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt592023.aspx) in the Configuration Manager console.  This functionality is available for PCs and on-premises resources managed by Configuration Manager and mobile devices managed with Microsoft Intune. Administrators can specify whether reporting is done via the cloud or on-premises infrastructure. This enables client PCs without internet access to enable and monitor devices using health attestation. Device health attestation lets the administrator ensure that client computers have the following trustworthy BIOS, TPM, and boot software configurations enabled:  
  
-   Early-launch antimalware - Early launch anti-malware (ELAM) protects your computer when it starts up and before third-party drivers initialize. [How to turn on ELAM](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/How-to-turn-on-Early-84552ec5)  
  
-   BitLocker - Windows BitLocker Drive Encryption is software that lets you encrypt all data stored on the Windows operating system volume.  [How to turn on Bitlocker](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/How-to-turn-on-BitLocker-34294d3d)  
  
-   Secure Boot - Secure Boot is a security standard developed by members of the PC industry to help make sure that your PC boots using only software that is trusted by the PC manufacturer. [Learn more about Secure Boot](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh824987.aspx)  
  
-   Code Integrity - Code Integrity is a feature that improves the security of the operating system by validating the integrity of a driver or system file each time it is loaded into memory. [Learn about Code Integrity](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dd348642.aspx)
