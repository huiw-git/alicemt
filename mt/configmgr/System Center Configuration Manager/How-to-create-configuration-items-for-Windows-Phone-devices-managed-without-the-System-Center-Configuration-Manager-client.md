# How to create configuration items for Windows Phone devices managed without the System Center Configuration Manager client
Use the [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)]**Windows Phone** configuration item to manage settings  for Windows Phone devices that are enrolled in Microsoft Intune or managed on-premises by [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
### To create a Windows Phone configuration item  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Assets and compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, and then click **Configuration Items**.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Configuration Item**.  
  
4.  On the **General** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, specify a name, and optional description for the configuration item.  
  
5.  Under **Specify the type of configuration item that you want to create**, select **Windows Phone**.  
  
6.  Click **Categories** if you create and assign categories to help you search and filter configuration items in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console.  
  
7.  On the **Supported Platforms** page of the wizard, select the specific Windows Phone platforms that will evaluate the configuration item.  
  
8.  On the **Device Settings** page of the wizard, select the settings group that you want to configure. See [Windows Phone configuration item settings reference](#BKMK_Setref) in this topic for details, and then click **Next**.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  If the setting that you want is not listed, select the **Configure additional settings that are not in the default setting groups check box**.  
  
9. On each settings page, configure the settings you require, and whether you want to remediate them when they are not compliant on devices (when this is supported).  
  
10. For each settings group, you can also configure the severity that will be reported when a configuration item is found to be noncompliant from:  
  
    -   **None** - Devices that fail this compliance rule do not report a failure severity for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] reports.  
  
    -   **Information** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Information** for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] reports.  
  
    -   **Warning** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Warning** for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] reports.  
  
    -   **Critical** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] reports.  
  
    -   **Critical with event** - Devices that fail this compliance rule report a failure severity of **Critical** for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] reports. This severity level is also be logged as a Windows event in the application event log.  
  
11. On the **Platform Applicability** page of the wizard, review any settings that are not compatible with the supported platforms you selected earlier. You can go back and remove these settings, or you can continue.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  Unsupported settings are not assessed for compliance.  
  
12. Complete the wizard.  
  
 You can view the new configuration item in the **Configuration Items** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace.
