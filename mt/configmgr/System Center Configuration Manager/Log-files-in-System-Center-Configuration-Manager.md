# Log files in System Center Configuration Manager
In [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)], client and site server components record process information in individual log files. By default, client and server component logging is enabled in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. You can use the information in these log files to help you troubleshoot issues that might occur in your [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] hierarchy.  
  
 The following sections provide details about the different log files. Use this information to view and monitor [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client and server logs for operation details and identify error information that might help you to troubleshoot any problems.

##  <a name="BKMK_AboutLogs"></a> About Configuration Manager Log Files  
 By default, most processes in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] write operational information to a log file that is dedicated to that process. These log files are identified by the **.LOG** or **.LO_** extension. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] writes to the .LOG file until that log reaches it maximum size. When the log is full, the .LOG file is copied to a file of the same name but with the .LO_ extension, and the process or component continues to write to the .LOG file. When the .LOG file again reaches its maximum size, the .LO_ file is overwritten and the process repeats. Some components establish a log file history by appending a date and time stamp to the log file name and by retaining the .LOG extension. An exception to the maximum size and use of the **.LO_** file is the client for Linux and UNIX. For information about how the client for Linux and UNIX uses log files, see Manage Log Files for the Client for Linux and UNIX in the [Client for Linux and UNIX](#BKMK_LogFilesforLnU) section in this topic.  
  
 To view the logs, you can use the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] log viewer tool, CMTrace, which is located in the **\SMSSETUP\TOOLS** folder of the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] source media. The CMTrace tool is also added to all boot images that are added to the **Software Library**.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_LogOptions"></a> Configure Logging Options by Using the Configuration Manager Service Manager  
 [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] supports options that enable you to change where log files are stored and the log file size.  
  
 Use the following procedure to use the **Configuration Manager Service Manager** to modify the size of log files, the name and location of the log file, and to force multiple components to write to a single log file.  
  
##### To modify logging for a component:  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Monitoring**, click **System Status**, and then click either **Site Status** or **Component Status**.  
  
2.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Component** group, click **Start** and select **Configuration Manager Service Manager**.  
  
3.  When the Configuration Manager Service Manager opens, connect to the site that you want to manage.  
  
     If you do not see the site that you want to manage, click **Site**, click **Connect**, and then enter the name of the site server for the correct site.  
  
4.  Expand the site and navigate to **Components** or **Servers**, depending on where the components that you want to manage are located.  
  
5.  In the right pane, select one or more components.  
  
6.  On the **Component** menu, click **Logging**.  
  
7.  In the **Configuration Manager Component Logging** dialog box, complete the available configuration options for your selection.  
  
8.  Click **OK** to save the configuration.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_LogLocation"></a> Locating Configuration Manager Logs  
 By default, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] log files are stored in a variety of locations that depend on the process that creates the log file, and on the configuration of your site systems. Because the location of the log on a given computer can vary, use search to locate the relevant log files on your [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] computers to help you troubleshoot a specific scenario.

> [!TIP]  
>  Beginning with client for Linux and UNIX from cumulative update 1, you can use CMTrace to view the log files for the client for Linux and UNIX.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  When you use the initial release of the client for Linux and UNIX and reference the documentation in this section, replace the following references for each file or process:  
>   
>  -   Replace **omiserver.bin** with **nwserver.bin**  
> -   Replace **omi** with **nanowbem**  
  
|Log name|Details|  
|--------------|-------------|  
|scxcm.log|This is the log file for the core service of the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client for Linux and UNIX (ccmexec.bin). This log file contains information about the installation and ongoing operations of ccmexec.bin.<br /><br /> By default, this log file is created in the following location: **/var/opt/microsoft/scxcm.log**<br /><br /> To change the location of the log file, edit **/opt/microsoft/configmgr/etc/scxcm.conf** and change the **PATH** field. You do not need to restart the client computer or service for the change to take effect.<br /><br /> You can set the log level to one of four different settings:|  
|scxcmprovider.log|This is the log file for the CIM service of the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client for Linux and UNIX (omiserver.bin). This log file contains information about the ongoing operations of nwserver.bin.<br /><br /> By default, this log is created in the following location: **/var/opt/microsoft/configmgr/scxcmprovider.log**<br /><br /> To change the location of the log file, edit **/opt/microsoft/omi/etc/scxcmprovider.conf** and change the **PATH** field. You do not need to restart the client computer or service for the change to take effect.<br /><br /> You can set the log level to one of three different settings:|  
  
 **Both log files support several levels of logging:**  
  
-   **scxcm.log** - To change the log level, edit **/opt/microsoft/configmgr/etc/scxcm.conf** and change each instance of the tag **MODULE** to the desired log level:  
  
    -   ERROR: Indicates problems that require attention.  
  
    -   WARNING: Indicates possible problems for the client operations.  
  
    -   INFO: More detailed logging that indicates the status of various events on the client.  
  
    -   TRACE: Verbose logging that is typically used to diagnose problems.  
  
-   **scxcmprovider.log** - To change the log level, edit **/opt/microsoft/omi/etc/scxcmprovider.conf** and change each instance of the tag **MODULE** to the desired log level:  
  
    -   ERROR: Indicates problems that require attention.  
  
    -   WARNING: Indicates possible problems for the client operations.  
  
    -   INFO: More detailed logging that indicates the status of various events on the client.  
  
 Under normal operating conditions the ERROR log level should be used. The ERROR level of logging creates the smallest log file. As the log level is increased from ERROR to WARNING to INFO to TRACE, each step results in a larger log file as more data is written to the log file.  
  
####  <a name="BKMK_ManageLinuxLogs"></a> Manage Log Files for the Client for Linux and UNIX Client  
 The client for Linux and UNIX does not limit the maximum size of the client log files, nor does the client automatically copy the contents of its **.LOG** files to another file such as a **.LO_** file. If you want to control the maximum size of log files, implement a process to manage the log files independent from the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client for Linux and UNIX.  
  
 For example, you can use the standard Linux and UNIX command **logrotate** to manage the size and rotation of the clients log files. The [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client for Linux and UNIX provides an interface that enables **logrotate** to signal the client as to when the log rotation completes, allowing the client to resume logging to the log file.  
  
 For information about **logrotate**, see the documentation for the Linux and UNIX distributions that you use.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_LogfilesforMac"></a> Client for Mac Computers  
 The [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client for Mac computers records information in the following log files.  
  
|Log name|Details|  
|--------------|-------------|  
|CCMClient-*<date_time>*.log|Records activities that are related to the Mac client operations, which includes application management, inventory, and error logging.<br /><br /> This log file is located in the folder **/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/CCM/Logs** on the Mac computer.|  
|CCMAgent-*<date_time>*.log|Records information that is related to client operations, which includes user logon and logoff operations and Mac computer activity.<br /><br /> This log file is located in the folder **~/Library/Logs** on the Mac computer.|  
|CCMNotifications-*<date_time>*.log|Records activities that are related to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] notifications displayed on the Mac computer.<br /><br /> This log file is located in the folder **~/Library/Logs** on the Mac computer.|  
|CCMPrefPane-*<date_time>*.log|Records activities related to the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] preferences dialog box on the Mac computer, which includes general status and error logging.<br /><br /> This log file is located in the folder **~/Library/Logs** on the Mac computer.|  
  
 Additionally, the log file SMS_DM.log on the site system server records communication between Mac computers and the management point that is enabled for mobile devices and Mac computers.
