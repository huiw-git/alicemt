# How to create custom configuration items for Windows desktop and server computers managed with the System Center Configuration Manager client
Use the [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)]**custom Windows Desktops and Servers** configuration item to manage settings  for Windows computers and servers that are managed by the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client.  
  
## Start the wizard and specify general information  
 Insert section body here.  
  
#### To create a custom Windows desktops and servers configuration item  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Assets and compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, and then click **Configuration Items**.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Configuration Item**.  
  
4.  On the **General** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, specify a name, and optional description for the configuration item.  
  
5.  Under **Specify the type of configuration item that you want to create**, select **Windows Desktops and Servers (custom)**.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  If you want to supply detection method settings that check for the existence of an application, select **This configuration file contains application settings**.  
  
6.  Click **Categories** if you create and assign categories to help you search and filter configuration items in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Step3"></a> Provide detection method information  
 Use this procedure to provide detection method information for the configuration item.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Applies only if you selected **This configuration item contains application settings** on the **General** page of the wizard.  
  
 A detection method in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] contains rules that are used to detect whether an application is installed on a computer. This detection occurs before the configuration item is assessed for compliance. To detect whether an application is installed, you can detect the presence of a Windows Installer file for the application, use a custom script, or select **Always assume application is installed** to assess the configuration item for compliance regardless of whether the application is installed.  
  
 Use these procedures to configure detection methods in [!INCLUDE[cm5short](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm5short_md.md)].  
  
#### To detect an application installation by using the Windows Installer File  
  
1.  On the **Detection Methods** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, select the **Use Windows Installer detection** check box.  
  
2.  Click **Open**, browse to the Windows Installer (.msi) file that you want to detect, and then click **Open**.  
  
3.  The **Version** box is automatically populated with the version number of the Windows Installer file that you selected. You can enter a new version number in this box if the displayed value is incorrect.  
  
4.  Select the **This application is installed for one or more users** check box if you want to detect each user profile on the computer.  
  
#### To detect a specific application and deployment type  
  
1.  On the **Detection Methods** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, select the **Detect a specific application and deployment type** check box, then click **Select**.  
  
2.  In the **Specify Application** dialog box, select the application and an associated deployment type that you want to detect.  
  
#### To detect an application installation by using a custom script  
  
1.  On the **Detection Methods** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, select the **Use a custom script to detect this application** check box.  
  
2.  In the list, select the language of the script you want to open. Choose from the following scripts:  
  
    -   **VBScript**  
  
    -   **JScript**  
  
    -   **PowerShell**  
  
3.  Click **Open**, browse to the script that you want to use, and then click **Open**.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Step4"></a> Configure settings  
 Use this procedure to configure the settings in the configuration item.  
  
 Settings represent the business or technical conditions that are used to assess compliance on client devices. You can configure a new setting or browse to an existing setting on a reference computer.  
  
#### To create a setting  
  
1.  On the **Settings** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, click **New**.  
  
2.  On the **General** tab of the **Create Setting** dialog box, provide the following information:  
  
    -   **Name:** Enter a unique name for the setting. You can use a maximum of 256 characters.  
  
    -   **Description:** Enter a description for the setting. You can use a maximum of 256 characters.  
  
    -   **Setting type:** In the list, choose and configure one of the following setting types to use for this setting:  
  
        -   **Active Directory query**  
  
             **LDAP prefix** - Specify a valid prefix to the Active Directory Domain Services query to assess compliance on client computers. You can use either **LDAP://** for a or **GC://** to perform a global catalog search..  
  
             **Distinguished Name (DN)** - Specify the distinguished name of the Active Directory Domain Services object that is assessed for compliance on client computers.  
  
             For example, if you want to evaluate a value related to a user named John Smith in the corp.contoso.com domain, enter the following:  
  
            -   **Search filter** - Specify an optional LDAP filter to refine the results from the Active Directory Domain Services query to assess compliance on client computers.  
  
                 To return all results from the query, enter **(objectclass=\*)**.  
  
            -   **Search scope** - Specify the search scope in Active Directory Domain Services/ You can choose from:  
  
                -   **Base** - Queries only the object that is specified.  
  
                -   **One Level** - This option is not used in this version of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
                -   **Subtree** - Queries the object that is specified and its complete subtree in the directory.  
  
            -   **Property** - Specify the property of the Active Directory Domain Services object that is used to assess compliance on client computers.  
  
                 For example, if you want to query the Active Directory property **badPwdCount**, which stores the number of times a user incorrectly enters a password, enter **badPwdCount** in this field.  
  
            -   **Query** - Displays the query constructed from the entries in **LDAP prefix**, **Distinguished name (DN)**, **Search Filter** (if specified), and **Property**, which are used to assess compliance on client computers.  
  
             For more information about constructing LDAP queries, see your Windows Server documentation.  
  
        -   **Assembly**  
  
             Configure the following for this setting type:  
  
            -   **Assembly name:** Specifies the name of the assembly object that you want to search for. The name cannot be the same as other assembly objects of the same type and must be registered in the Global Assembly Cache. The assembly name can be up to 256 characters long.  
  
             An assembly is a piece of code that can be shared between applications. Assemblies can have the file name extension .dll or .exe. The Global Assembly Cache is a folder named *%systemroot%\Assembly* on client computers where all shared assemblies are stored.  
  
        -   **File system**  
  
            -   **Type** â€“ In the list, select whether you want to search for a **File** or a **Folder**.

                > [!NOTE]  
                >  If you use the *%USERPROFILE%* environment variable in the **Path** or **File or folder name** boxes, all user profiles on the client computer are searched, which could result in multiple instances of the file or folder that is found.  
                >   
                >  If compliance settings do not have access to the specified path, a discovery error is generated. Additionally, if the file you are searching for is currently in use, a discovery error is generated.  
  
            -   **File or folder name** - Specify the name of the file or folder object to search for. You can specify system environment variables and the *%USERPROFILE%* environment variable in the file or folder name. You can also use the wildcards * and ? in the file name.  
  
                > [!NOTE]  
                >  If you specify a file or folder name and use wildcards, this combination might produce a high numbers of results and could result in high resource use on the client computer and high network traffic when reporting results to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
            -   **Include subfolders** â€“ Enable this option if you also want to search any subfolders under the specified path.  
  
            -   **This file or folder is associated with a 64-bit application** - If enabled, only 64-bit file locations (such as *%ProgramFiles%*) will be checked on 64-bit computers. If this option is not enabled, both 32-bit (such as *%ProgramFiles(x86)%*) and 64-bit locations will be checked.  
  
                > [!NOTE]  
                >  If the same file or folder exists in both the 64-bit and 32-bit system file locations on the same 64-bit computer, multiple files are discovered by the global condition.  
  
             The **File system** setting type does not support specifying a UNC path to a network share in the **Path** box.  
  
        -   **IIS metabase**  
  
            -   **Metabase path** - Specify a valid path to the Internet Information Services (IIS) Metabase.

        >  The **Floating point** data type supports only 3 digits after the decimal point.  
  
3.  Configure additional details about this setting under the **Setting type** list. The items you can configure vary depending on the setting type you have selected.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you create settings of the type **File system**, **Registry key**, and **Registry value**, you can click **Browse** to configure the setting from values on a reference computer. To browse to a registry key or value on a remote computer, the remote computer must have the Remote Registry service enabled.  
  
4.  Click **OK** to save the setting and close the **Create Setting** dialog box.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Step5"></a> Configure compliance rules  
 Use the following procedure to configure compliance rules for the configuration item.  
  
 Compliance rules specify the conditions that define the compliance of a configuration item. Before a setting can be evaluated for compliance, it must have at least one compliance rule. WMI, registry, and script settings let you remediate values that are found to be noncompliant. You can create new rules or browse to an existing setting in any configuration item to select rules in it.  
  
#### To create a compliance rule  
  
1.  On the **Compliance Rules** page of the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**, click **New**.  
  
2.  In the **Create Rule** dialog box, provide the following information:  
  
    -   **Name:** Enter a name for the compliance rule.  
  
    -   **Description:** Enter a description for the compliance rule.  
  
    -   **Selected setting:** Click **Browse** to open the **Select Setting** dialog box. Select the setting that you want to define a rule for, or click **New Setting**. When you are finished, click **Select**.

        >  You can also click **Properties** to view information about the currently selected setting.  
  
    -   **Rule type:** Select the type of compliance rule that you want to use:  
  
        -   **Value** Create a rule that compares the value returned by the configuration item against a value that you specify.  
  
        -   **Existential** Create a rule that evaluates the setting depending on whether it exists on a client device or on the number of times it is found.  
  
    -   For a rule type of **Value**, specify the following information:  
  
        -   **The setting must comply with the following rule** â€“ Select an operator and a value which is assessed for compliance with the selected setting. You can use the following operators:  
  
            |Operator|More information|  
            |--------------|----------------------|  
            |Equals|No additional information|

        -   **Remediate noncompliant rules when supported** â€“ Select this option if you want [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to automatically remediate noncompliant rules. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] can automatically remediate the following rule types:  
  
            -   **Registry value** â€“ The registry value is remediated if it is noncompliant, and created if it does not exist.  
  
            -   **Script** (by automatically running a remediation script).  
  
            -   **WQL Query**  
  
            > [!IMPORTANT]  
            >  You can only remediate noncompliant rules when the rule operator is set to **Equals**.  
  
        -   **Report noncompliance if this setting instance is not found** â€“ The configuration item reports noncompliance if this setting is not found on client computers.  
  
        -   **Noncompliance severity for reports:** Specify the severity level that is reported if this compliance rule fails. The available severity levels are the following:  
  
            -   **None** Computers that fail this compliance rule do not report a failure severity for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] reports.
