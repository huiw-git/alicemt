# Documentation for System Center Configuration Manager
Welcome to Microsoft [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)]. Use [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] to provide more effective IT services by enabling secure and scalable software deployment, compliance settings management, and comprehensive asset management of servers, desktops, laptops, and mobile devices.  
  
 The information in this documentation library is divided into sections that fit the approach taken by many enterprises to learn about, deploy, and  manage [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] infrastructure and managed devices.  
  
## Introduction to Configuration Manager  
 The [Introduction to System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Introduction-to-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) section presents an overview of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. Here you'll find information about the capabilities of the product, fundamental concepts, and a guide to help you deploy [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] in a lab so you can evaluate how it can meet your business needs.  
  
## Get your infrastructure ready to run Configuration Manager  
 In [Get ready for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Get-ready-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) you'll find information that helps you plan for a production deployment of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. This includes resources to plan for both individual sites and hierarchies of sites, and how to prepare your on-premises servers and network infrastructure to support [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
## Install and configure Configuration Manager  
 When you're ready to deploy your [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] infrastructure, the information in [Start using System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Start-using-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) will guide you through the process of installing one or more sites, and then getting those sites and the hierarchy of sites configured to fit your business needs.  
  
## Manage computers and devices  
 With a configured site or hierarchy, the information in [Manage computers and devices with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Manage-computers-and-devices-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) will help you get devices managed by [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. This includes getting your devices actively managed using software clients you install on devices or by using the  on-premises mobile device management option, which does not use the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client.  
  
## Hybrid mobile device management with Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune  
 You can choose to configure [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to manage a variety of mobile device platforms using the information in [Hybrid mobile device management (MDM) with System Center Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune](../System Center Configuration Manager/Hybrid-mobile-device-management--MDM--with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-and-Microsoft-Intune.md). The guidance in this section will help you deploy and set up [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] to manage mobile devices through the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console to give you a unified management experience across all your devices and computers.  
  
## Manage operating systems  
 If you're ready to update or replace the operating system of computers you manage, then you'll want to understand how to [Manage enterprise operating systems with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Manage-enterprise-operating-systems-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) with [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  Not only can you seamlessly upgrade or replace operating systems on computers you manage, you can load corporate approved images onto new hardware before a user every logs on.  
  
## Deploy applications  
 In [Deploy and manage applications with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Deploy-and-manage-applications-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) you'll learn how to deliver all kinds of apps to your users and devices, how to update them, and how to get rid of them when you don't need them anymore.  
  
## Manage software updates  
 Learn how to manage, deploy, and monitor software updates in the enterprise in [Deploy and manage software updates in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Deploy-and-manage-software-updates-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
## Manage device compliance  
 When you can't let users run specific programs, or need to enforce a device configuration before you allow your users to access your corporate resources, find out how in [Ensure device compliance with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Ensure-device-compliance-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
## Protect data and infrastructure  
 Both the data you collect from and about devices you manage and the infrastructure you use to manage those devices needs to be protected. In [Protect data and site infrastructure with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Protect-data-and-site-infrastructure-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) you'll learn about  using  Endpoint Protection and using Conditional Access to ensure only devices that you consider safe and protected are able to access your corporate resources.  
  
## Monitor and maintain your infrastructure  
 While [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] helps you accomplish quite a lot of tasks, you must [Monitor and maintain System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Monitor-and-maintain-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) to keep it running smoothly.  Whether  you want to view reports about installed software or site operations, maintain your sites SQL Server Database by purging older data, or ensure your infrastructure operates efficiently, this is information you should  be aware of.
