# Supported operating systems for clients and devices for System Center Configuration Manager



 System Center Configuration Manager supports installing client software on a variety of Windows, Mac and Linux and UNIX computers.  
  
 **Requirements and limitations for all clients:**  
  
-   It is not supported to change the startup type or Log on as settings for any [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] service. Doing so can prevent key services from running correctly.    

-   It is not supported to install or run the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client for Linux or UNIX or the client for Mac on computers under an account other than root. Doing so can prevent key services from running correctly.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_WinClientos"></a> Windows computers  
 You can manage Windows computers with the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client that is included with Configuration Manager. For more information see [How to deploy clients to Windows computers in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-deploy-clients-to-Windows-computers-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).

 <sup>2</sup> To support client push installation, the computer that runs this operating system version must run the File Server role service for the File and Storage Services server role. For information about installing Windows features on a Server Core computer, see [Install Server Roles and Features on a Server Core Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299359) in the Windows Server 2012 TechNet library.  
  
 <sup>3</sup> Use of  this operating system requires version 1602 or later.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_EmbeddedOS"></a> Windows Embedded  
 You can manage Windows Embedded devices by installing [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client software on the device.  For more information see [Planning for client deployment to Windows Embedded devices in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Planning-for-client-deployment-to-Windows-Embedded-devices-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
 **Requirements and limitations:**

## Mac computers  
 You can manage Mac OS X computers with the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client for Mac.  
  
 The Mac client installation package is not supplied with the Configuration Manager media. You can download it as part of the Clients for Additional Operating Systems download from the    [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525184)  
  
 **Requirements and limitations:**  
  
 You must use the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client for Mac (version  5.0.8333.1 or later), which must be separately downloaded. Unlike the Windows client, the Mac client is not included in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] software when you install it. To download the Mac client, go to [Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager - Clients for Additional Operating Systems](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525184).  
  
 For more information, see [How to deploy clients to Macs in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-deploy-clients-to-Macs-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
 **Supported versions:**  
  
-   **Mac OS X 10.9** (Mavericks)

##  <a name="bkmk_LinuxOS"></a> Linux and UNIX servers  
 You can manage Linux and UNIX servers with the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client for Linux and UNIX.  
  
 The Linux and UNIX  client installation packages are  are not supplied with the Configuration Manager media. You can download them  as part of the Clients for Additional Operating Systems download from the    [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525184). In addition to client installation packages, the client download includes the install script that manages the installation of the client on each computer.  
  
 **Requirements and limitations:**  
  
-   To review operating system file dependencies for the client for Linux and UNIX, see [Prerequisites for Client Deployment to Linux and UNIX Servers](../System Center Configuration Manager/Planning-for-client-deployment-to-Linux-and-UNIX-computers-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_ClientDeployPrereqforLnU).  

-   For an overview of the management capabilities supported for computers that run Linux or UNIX, see[How to deploy clients to UNIX and Linux servers in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-deploy-clients-to-UNIX-and-Linux-servers-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  

-   For supported versions of Linux and UNIX, the listed version includes all subsequent minor versions. For example, where support is indicated for CentOS version 6, this also includes any subsequent minor version of CentOS 6, such as CentOS 6.3. Similarly, when support is listed for an operating system that uses service packs, such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1, support includes subsequent service packs for that operating system version.  

-   For information about client installation packages and the Universal Agent, see [How to deploy clients to UNIX and Linux servers in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-deploy-clients-to-UNIX-and-Linux-servers-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).
