# Example scenario for using System Center Configuration Manager to deploy and monitor the security software updates released monthly by Microsoft
This topic provides an example scenario of how you can use software updates in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] to deploy and monitor the security software updates that Microsoft releases monthly.  
  
 In this scenario, John is the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] administrator at Woodgrove Bank. John needs to create a software update deployment strategy with the following conditions and requirements:  
  
-   Active software update deployment occurs one week after Microsoft releases the security software updates on the second Tuesday of each month. This event is typically referred to as Patch Tuesday.  
  
-   Software updates are downloaded and staged on distribution points. Then a deployment is tested to a subset of clients before John fully deploys the software updates in his production environment.  
  
-   John must be able to monitor the software updates' compliance by month or by year.  
  
 This scenario assumes that the software update point infrastructure has already been implemented. Use the information in the following table to plan for and configure software updates in [!INCLUDE[cm5short](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm5short_md.md)].

|Plan for software updates. This information helps you to plan for capacity considerations, determine the software update point infrastructure, software update point installation, synchronization settings, and client settings for software updates.|[Plan for software updates in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Plan-for-software-updates-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md)|  
|Configure software updates. This information helps you to install and configure software update points in your hierarchy and helps to configure and synchronize software updates.<br /><br /> In this scenario, John configures the software updates synchronization schedule to occur on the second Wednesday of each month to ensure that he retrieves the latest security software updates from Microsoft.|[Configure software updates in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Configure-software-updates-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md)|  
  
 The following sections in this topic provide example procedural steps to help you to deploy and monitor [!INCLUDE[cm5short](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm5short_md.md)] security software updates in your organization:

##  <a name="BKMK_Step1"></a> Step 1: Create a Software Update Group for Yearly Compliance  
 John creates a software update group that he can use to monitor compliance for all of the security software updates that he releases in 2012. He performs the steps in the following table.  
  
|Process|Reference|  
|-------------|---------------|  
|From the **All Software Updates** node in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, John adds criteria to display only security software updates that are released or revised in year 2015 that meet the following criteria:<br /><br /> -   **Criteria**: Date Released or Revised<br />     **Condition**: is greater than or equal to specific date<br />     **Value**: 1/1/2015<br />-   **Criteria**: Update Classification<br />     **Value**: Security Updates<br />-   **Criteria**: Expired<br />     **Value**: No|No additional information|  
|John adds all of the filtered software updates to a new software update group with the following requirements:<br /><br /> -   **Name**: Compliance Group - Microsoft Security Updates 2015<br />-   **Description**: Software updates|[Add software updates to an update group](../System Center Configuration Manager/Manage-software-updates-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_AddUpdatesToGroup)|  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Step2"></a> Step 2: Create an Automatic Deployment Rule for the Current Month  
 John creates an automatic deployment rule for the security software updates that are released by Microsoft for the current month. He performs the steps in the following table.  
  
|Process|Reference|  
|-------------|---------------|  
|John creates an automatic deployment rule with the following requirements:<br /><br /> <ol><li>On the **General** tab, John configures the following:<br /><br /> <ul><li>He specifies **Monthly Security Updates** for the name.</li><li>He selects a test collection with limited clients.</li><li>He selects **Create a new Software Update Group**.</li><li>He verifies that **Enable the deployment after this rule is run** is not selected.</li></ul></li><li>On the **Deployment Settings** tab, John selects the default settings.</li><li>On the Software Updates page, John configures the following property filters and search criteria:<br /><br /> <ul><li>Date Released or Revised **Last 1 month**.</li><li>Update Classification **Security Updates**.</li></ul></li><li>On the Evaluation page, John enables the rule to run on a schedule for the second Thursday of every month. John also verifies that his synchronization schedule is set to run on the second Wednesday of every month.</li><li>John uses the default settings on the Deployment Schedule, User Experience, Alerts, and Download Settings pages.</li><li>On the Deployment Package page, John specifies a new deployment package.</li><li>John uses the default settings on the Download Location and Language Selection pages.</li></ol>|[Automatically deploy software updates](../System Center Configuration Manager/Manage-software-updates-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_AutoDeploy)|
