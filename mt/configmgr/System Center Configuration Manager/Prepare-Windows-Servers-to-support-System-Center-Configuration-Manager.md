# Prepare Windows Servers to support System Center Configuration Manager
Before you can use a Windows computer as a site system server for [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)], you must ensure that the computer meets the prerequisites for its intended use as a site server or site system server.  
  
-   These often include one or more Windows features or roles, which are enabled by using the computers Server Manager.  
  
-   Because the method to enable Windows features and roles differs with different operating systems, refer to the documentation for your operating system for detailed information about configuring these for the operating systems you use.  
  
  The information in this article provides an overview of the types of Windows configurations that are required to support [!INCLUDE[cmshort_md](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] site systems. For configuration details for specific site system roles, see the [Prerequisites for site system roles](Supported%20operating%20systems%20for%20sites%20and%20clients%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager.md#bkmk_Prrequisites) in the [Supported operating systems for sites and clients](Supported%20operating%20systems%20for%20sites%20and%20clients%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager.md) topic. 
  
##  <a name="BKMK_WinFeatures"></a> Windows features and roles  
 When you configure Windows features and roles on a computer, you might be required to reboot the computer to complete that configuration. Therefore, we recommend you identify which computers will host which site system roles in advance of installing a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] site or site system server.
### Features  
 The following Windows features are required on certain site system servers  and should be configured before you install a sites system role on that computer.  
  
-   **.NET Framework**: Including  
  
    -   ASP.NET  
  
    -   HTTP Activation  
  
    -   Non-HTTP Activation  
  
    -   WCF Services  
  
     Different versions of .NET Framework are required by different site system roles.  
  
     Because .NET Framework 4.0 and later is not backward compatible to replace 3.5 and earlier, when different versions are listed as required, plan to enable each version on the same computer.  
  
-   **Background Intelligent Transfer Services (BITS)**: Management points require BITS (and automatically selected options) to support communication with managed devices.  
  
-   **BranchCache**: Distribution points can be configured with BranchCache to support Clients that use BranchCache.  
  
-   **Data Deduplication**: Distribution points can be configured with and benefit from data deduplication.  
  
-   **Remote Differential Compression (RDC)**: Each computer that hosts a site server or a distribution point requires RDC.   
    RDC is used to generate package signatures and perform signature comparisons.  
  
### Roles  
 The following Windows roles are required to support specific functionality, like software updates and operating system deployments, while IIS is required by the most common site system roles.  
  
-   **Network Device Enrollment Service** (under Active Directory Certificate Services):  This Windows role is a prerequisite to using Certificate Profiles in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
-   **Web server (IIS)**: Including:  
  
    -   Common HTTP Features >  
  
        -   HTTP Redirection  
  
    -   Application Development >  
  
        -   .NET Extensibility  
  
        -   ASP.NET  
  
        -   ISAPI Extensions  
  
        -   ISAPI Filters  
  
    -   Management Tools >  
  
        -   IIS 6 Management Compatibility  
  
        -   IIS 6 Metabase Compatibility  
  
        -   IIS 6 WMI Compatibility  
  
    -   Security >  
  
        -   Request Filtering  
  
        -   Windows Authentication  
  
     The following site system roles use one or more of the listed IIS Configurations:  
  
    -   Application Catalog web service point  
  
    -   Application Catalog website point  
  
    -   Distribution point  
  
    -   Enrollment point  
  
    -   Enrollment proxy point  
  
    -   Fallback status point  
  
    -   Management point  
  
    -   Software update point  
  
    -   State migration point  
  
     The minimum version of IIS that is required is the version that is supplied with the operating system of the site server.  
  
     In addition to these IIS configurations, you might need to configure [IIS Request Filtering for distribution points](#BKMK_IISFiltering).  
  
-   **Windows Deployment Services**: This role is used with Operating System Deployment.  
  
-   **Windows Server Update Services**: This role is required when you will deploy software updates.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_IISFiltering"></a> IIS Request Filtering for distribution points  
 By default, IIS uses request filtering to block several file name extensions and folder locations from access by HTTP or HTTPS communication. On a distribution point, this prevents clients from downloading packages that contain blocked extensions or folder locations.  
  
 When your package source files contain extensions that are blocked in IIS by your request filtering configuration, you must configure request filtering to allow them. This is done by [editing the Request Filtering Feature](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831621.aspx) in the IIS Manager on your distribution point computers.  
  
 Additionally, the following file name extensions are used by [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] for packages and applications. Ensure your Request Filtering configurations do not block these file extensions:  
  
-   .PCK  
  
-   .PKG  
  
-   .STA  
  
-   .TAR  
  
 For example, you might have source files for a software deployment that include a folder named **bin**, or that contain a file with the **.mdb** file name extension.  
  
-   By default, IIS request filtering blocks access to these elements (**bin** is blocked as a Hidden Segment and **.mdb** is blocked as a File Name Extension).  
  
-   When you use the default IIS configuration on a distribution point, clients that use BITS fail to download this software deployment from the distribution point and indicate that they are waiting for content.  
  
-   To enable the clients to download this content, on each applicable distribution point, edit **Request Filtering** in IIS Manager to allow access to the file extensions and folders contained in the packages and applications you deploy.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Edits to the Request Filter can increase the attack surface of the computer.  
>   
>  -   Edits you make at the Server level apply to all websites on the server  
> -   Edits you make to individual websites apply to only that website  
>   
>  The security best practice is to run [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] on a dedicated web server. If you must run other applications on the web server, use a custom website for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. For information, see [Websites for site system servers in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Websites-for-site-system-servers-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).
