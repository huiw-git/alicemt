# SCRATCH - Intune standalone vs hybrid MDM
One of the most commonly asked questions regarding mobile device management (MDM) with [!INCLUDE[mit_first](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_first_md.md)] is "Should I deploy hybrid MDM with [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] or run [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone in the cloud only configuration?" It’s an important decision, and one that is not easily changed after implementation.  
  
 An [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone deployment involves no on-premises infrastructure, and is managed via a web console. It is agile and lightweight, and popular with cloud-first minded organizations.  
  
 A hybrid MDM deployment involves [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)], and is managed using tools familiar to experienced [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] admins. It offers “single pane of glass” management of MDM and traditional clients, as well as scale in large environments.

##  <a name="Intune"></a> What does Intune standalone mean?  
 [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] at its core is a cloud service. There are [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] datacenters hosted in North America, Europe and Asia providing mobile devices with security policies, email and Wi-Fi profiles, applications, inventory, and more.  
  
 An [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone implementation does not require any on-premises infrastructure. All configuration, management, deployment and reporting are performed via a web-based console, which is accessible from anywhere in the world.  
  
 For working with on-premises applications, such as Microsoft Exchange and Network Device Enrollment Service (NDES), on-premises connectors are available to provide connectivity into the [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] service.  
  
 Being a cloud service, [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] can be built and deployed in a short timeframe.  
  
##  <a name="hybrid"></a> What does hybrid MDM mean?  
 For organizations who want to maximize their [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] investment, customers who need fine-grained control, or customers who exceed scale limitations of [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)], a hybrid  implementation that uses [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] to manage mobile devices  is available.  
  
 Hybrid deployments require  [!INCLUDE[cm5long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm5long_md.md)] SP1 or above.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] service is connected to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] with the Service Connection Point site system role (formally known as the Microsoft Intune Connector), which installed at either central administration or primary site of a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] hierarchy. An [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] tenant can only be connected to one [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] hierarchy, and a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] hierarchy can only be connected to one [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] tenant.  
  
 In a hybrid MDM configuration, some of the processing and storage overhead is performed by [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] infrastructure on-premises. This efficiency gain allows hybrid MDM to scale further than [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone.  
  
 A hybrid deployment allows the use of tools that are familiar to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] admins. Advanced functionality such as Role Based Administration Control (RBAC), SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), and complex device and user grouping using Collection Membership Queries become available for mobile devices when hybrid MDM is implemented.  
  
##  <a name="choices_timelines"></a> Planning choices and Intune deployment timelines  
 [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] innovation and evolution is occurring at a rapid pace with monthly updates providing new or enhanced features, enhanced scale, new admin-console experiences through the Azure Portal, dynamic groups through Azure Active Directory, and more. As such, any design decisions should take into account the future direction of the product.  
  
 Many of the unique abilities that a hybrid configuration currently provides will be functionally replicated in [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone as the service is developed in the short, medium, and long term.  
  
 If you're deciding between standalone and hybrid, you should take into consideration the deployment timelines. It is common for customers to go through multiple deployment iterations including design, build, user acceptance testing, and pilot phases, often taking many months to complete, before they are ready to deploy into production. For this reason, when choosing an [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] hierarchy design, take into consideration the time in which the actual deployment will occur and the short, medium,  and long term direction of the service.  
  
 As the [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] service continues to evolve, our goal is to simplify your configuration choice. In the future, the only reason for choosing a hybrid MDM environment should be for customers who require a single management console for both traditional clients and mobile devices.  We’re doing a lot of work to enhance scalability, adding role-based access through the Azure Portal, and dynamic groups through deeper Azure Active Directory integration, all aligned to short and medium term service updates.  
  
 Finally, we’re also working to assure that whatever configuration choice you make today, you’re able to move easily between hybrid and standalone configuration choices in a frictionless way. Switching MDM authorities today requires manual intervention from Microsoft Support, and significant effort by the tenant. To simplify this, our goal is to allow coexistence of hybrid and [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone, allowing you to move users between the two types of management, but not requiring you to choose one configuration over the other.  This change also removes today’s challenges of having to call support and eliminates un-enrolling and re-enrolling devices.

|-|-|  
|![hybrid&#45;1](../System Center Configuration Manager/medias/hybrid-1.png "hybrid-1")|**How many devices are you planning to manage?**<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone supports up to 50,000 devices. Hybrid MDM  supports up to 300,000 devices.<br /><br /> For any deployment of significant size – standalone or hybrid MDM – we suggest you contact your Microsoft accounts team. Your Microsoft accounts team can put you in contact with [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] specialists who can discuss scale and limitations further.|  
|![hybrid&#45;2](../System Center Configuration Manager/medias/hybrid-2.png "hybrid-2")|**Is fine-grained access control required? (RBAC)**<br /><br /> Role Based Access Control (RBAC)  was added to [!INCLUDE[cm5short](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm5short_md.md)]. RBAC allows [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] administrators to design and deploy complex permission-sets, to restrict admin access to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] objects and functions.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone provides only two administrator roles: Full Access and Read-only Access.<br /><br /> If your organization needs to scope certain admins to certain users, devices, functions, or objects, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] with RBAC is required.<br /><br /> If your organization has a small administrative team, and you don’t need the complexity of fine-grained access control, [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] with built-in security roles is the best fit.|  
|![hybrid&#45;3](../System Center Configuration Manager/medias/hybrid-3.png "hybrid-3")|**Are advanced reporting capabilities required?**<br /><br /> Hybrid MDM with [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] includes advanced reporting functionality using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS). [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] comes with 34 built-in MDM reports and over 400 standard [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] reports. SSRS also allows admins and business analysts to write their own custom reports. Further, the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] database can be queried by external tools, such as orchestration tools, to provide specific functions such as custom alerting. Being [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] run reports, all reports can also include non-MDM data, such as traditional PC inventory side-by-side with mobile device inventory.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone provides 9 reports. These reports are not customizable, and offer limited input variables. Reports can be printed, or exported into CSV or HTML.<br /><br /> If your organization requires advanced reporting functions, and has the bandwidth and knowledge to manage SSRS, hybrid MDM is the best fit.<br /><br /> If your organization wants a simple to use reporting engine and predefined reports, [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone’s reporting functionality should be sufficient.|  
|![hybrid&#45;4](../System Center Configuration Manager/medias/hybrid-4.png "hybrid-4")|**Are you managing Windows 10 devices without Internet access?**<br /><br /> In [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] (current branch), Windows 10 devices can be managed via the MDM channel using only  on-premises infrastructure.<br /><br /> The [!INCLUDE[onprem_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/onprem_next_md.md)] feature is designed to allow MDM management for non-Internet accessible clients, and is primarily targeted at single use devices (such as kiosk devices) and IoT devices.<br /><br /> Due to [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone’s cloud-only approach, all managed devices must have Internet access. If your organization wants to manage Windows 10 devices via [!INCLUDE[onprem_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/onprem_next_md.md)], an hybrid MDM configuration is required. Note that [!INCLUDE[onprem_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/onprem_next_md.md)] does not support managing both Internet and intranet mobile devices at the same time.|  
|![hybrid&#45;5](../System Center Configuration Manager/medias/hybrid-5.png "hybrid-5")|**Do you need full app Inventory?**<br /><br /> By default, [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone will only collect app inventory for apps that [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] manages and deploys. This means inventory reports will not contain information for side-loaded apps that have been installed by users outside of the [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] Company Portal.<br /><br /> Hybrid MDM with [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] allows admins to designate certain devices as "company owned". When a device is set as a company-owned device, extended app inventory is gathered, providing access to a devices full app list.<br /><br /> If your organization requires information about personally installed apps from managed devices, hybrid MDM is required. Before making a decision based on this choice, consider the impact to your end user’s privacy.|  
|![hybrid&#45;6](../System Center Configuration Manager/medias/hybrid-6.png "hybrid-6")|**Do you want to manage PC’s in the traditional fat-client manner?**<br /><br /> One benefit hybrid MDM offers over a standalone configuration is "single pane of glass" management. This means an organization can manage their entire fleet of desktop computers, servers, and mobile devices from the one management tool, the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console. Also with the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client, advanced management functions such as hardware and software inventory, software update management, software deployment, and operating system deployment are available for non-mobile devices.<br /><br /> If your organization wishes to manage traditional Windows, Linux/UNIX, and Mac clients, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] is the premier management platform.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone also offers traditional PC management (Windows 7, 8.1, and 10) using the [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] PC management client. It offers basic PC management, include hardware inventory, Windows updates, Endpoint Protection, and simple software deployment. The client does not work with [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)], so can be used in both [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone and hybrid MDM deployments.|  
|![hybrid&#45;7](../System Center Configuration Manager/medias/hybrid-7.png "hybrid-7")|**Do you want to manage on-premises infrastructure?**<br /><br /> A certain level of management overhead and complexity comes with any on-premises infrastructure. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] is a product that requires significant knowledge, experience, and investment to manage and maintain its infrastructure.<br /><br /> At a minimum, hybrid MDM requires a single [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] primary site, with the database role, reporting services role, and the service connection point role. If traditional PC management is required, the management point, distribution point, software update point, and application catalog roles may also be required. Advanced functions, such as certificate deployment, Mac management, and Endpoint Protection add even more roles and complexity.<br /><br /> The [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] hierarchy requires significant management and maintenance to ensure it’s healthy and functioning as required.<br /><br /> If the overhead of a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] hierarchy is not desired, an [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone deployment is your best option.|  
|![hybrid&#45;8](../System Center Configuration Manager/medias/hybrid-8.png "hybrid-8")|**Do you require external tooling?**<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] is a mature, enterprise grade product and includes many ways to interact with the service without using the console. A hybrid MDM deployment allows admins to use the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] SDK or PowerShell to programmatically manage mobile devices. It also allows admins to utilize tools such as System Center Orchestrator, PowerBI , and various third party add-ins.<br /><br /> In an [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone deployment, all administration must be performed via the Silverlight console and no external tooling is available.|  
|![hybrid&#45;9](../System Center Configuration Manager/medias/hybrid-9.png "hybrid-9")|**Do you want rapid MDM feature updates?**<br /><br /> Even though [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] (current branch) offers rapid servicing of updates and features, the development of cloud services, such as  [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)], lends itself well to even faster production deployment.<br /><br /> [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone will always likely receive new features before a hybrid MDM deployment.<br /><br /> If your organization likes to be cutting edge, [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] standalone will offer the newest MDM features in the timeliest manner.|
