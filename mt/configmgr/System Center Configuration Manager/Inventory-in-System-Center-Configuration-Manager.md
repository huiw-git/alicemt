# Inventory in System Center Configuration Manager
You can use a number of methods in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] to inventory hardware and software in your organization. Use hardware inventory for detailed information about the hardware of client computers and mobile devices that are enrolled by [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. Use software inventory for information about software and files present on client computers. Asset Intelligence extends these inventory capabilities to help you manage licenses for software in the enterprise.
