# Manage and protect apps with System Center Configuration Manager
In this section, you'll find information about how to protect, configure, and manage [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] applications.  
  
## Mobile application management  
 App management policies let you modify the functionality of apps that you deploy to help bring them into line with your company compliance and security policies. For example, you can restrict cut, copy, and paste operations within a restricted app, or configure an app to open all web links inside a managed browser.

## General application  management tasks  
 Learn about the tasks you can perform to further configure and manage applications and deployment types you have created.

## Managed Browser policies  
 You can deploy the Intune Managed Browser, a web browsing application, and associate the application with a managed browser policy. The managed browser policy configures an allow list or a block list that restricts the web sites that users of the managed browser can visit.

## Manage volume-purchased iOS apps  
 [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] can help you deploy and manage apps you purchased in volume from the Apple Volume-Purchase Program (VPP) by importing the license information from the app store and tracking how many of the licenses you have used.

 ## Manage apps from the Windows Store for Business
 [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] can help you deploy and manage apps you purchased in volume from the Windows Store for Business by importing the license information from the app store and tracking how many of the licenses you have used.

## iOS app configuration policies  
 Some iOS applications support pre-configuring settings such as a server or database that the application should connect to. Configuration Manager now supports deploying app configuration policies to the device which enable the user to use the app immediately without needing to know this information which can help to cut down on support calls.
