# Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP) for System Center Configuration Manager
During installation of the [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] console, you have the opportunity to choose to participate in the **Customer Experience Improvement Program** (CEIP). Although CEIP is turned off by default, if it was previously enabled, it will remain enabled.  
  
-   CEIP is separate from [Diagnostics and usage data for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Diagnostics-and-usage-data-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
-   CEIP is per console, collecting data such as the number of times each element is clicked in the user interface.  
  
-   Read the [CEIP privacy statement](http://www.microsoft.com/products/ceip/privacypolicy.mspx?mkt=en-us) online.  
  
 You can change the CEIP settings per console install. In the console, go to the consoles backstage tab (the upper left tab with the drop down arrow)  and select **Customer Experience Improvement Program** to change the settings.
