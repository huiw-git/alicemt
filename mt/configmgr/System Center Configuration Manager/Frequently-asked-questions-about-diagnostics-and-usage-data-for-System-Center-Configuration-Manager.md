# Frequently asked questions about diagnostics and usage data for System Center Configuration Manager
The following are frequently asked questions about diagnostic and usage data for [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)]:  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_off"></a> How do I turn off telemetry?  
 The current branch of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] needs to be updated on a regular basis in order to support new versions of Windows 10 and [!INCLUDE[mit_first](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_first_md.md)]. Microsoft requires at least the Basic level of diagnostic and usage data to keep the product up to date, improve the update experience, and improve the quality and security of the product.  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_retention"></a> What is the data retention period?  
 Diagnostic and usage data is retained for one year.  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_update"></a> Is diagnostics and usage data sent when installing or updating the product?  
 No. Diagnostics and usage data is only sent after the site is installed and operational.  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_frequency"></a> How frequently is the data sent?  
 The SQL stored procedures run every seven days (from the date the site is installed). In online mode, the service connection point is configured to upload the data after the queries run. In offline mode, the administrator uses the service connection tool to upload the data. (Note: the data is not initially available for offline use until seven days after the site is installed.)  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_network"></a> Can the data be used to form a network map?  
 As shown in the description of [Levels of diagnostic usage data collection for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Levels-of-diagnostic-usage-data-collection-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md), site details include timezone information from each site. This can provide insights into the broad geolocation and global dispersion of sites in a hierarchy. However, no network details, such as IP addresses or more detailed geographical information, is collected.  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_tables"></a> Can you see data in custom tables?  
 No. Diagnostics and usage data is collected via SQL stored procedures against default product tables in the database (all of which are prefixed with **TEL_** ). As part of the SQL schema detection query, all table names are hashed for comparison against the known defaults. This can determine that custom tables exist in the database (that the database schema is extended from the default) but not any of the data contained within those tables.  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_databases"></a> Can you see names of other databases, or data in other databases?  
 No. The stored procedures to collect data are limited to the site database.
