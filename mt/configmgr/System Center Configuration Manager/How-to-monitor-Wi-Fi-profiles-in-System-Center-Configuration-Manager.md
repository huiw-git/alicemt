# How to monitor Wi-Fi profiles in System Center Configuration Manager
After you have deployed [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] Wi-Fi profiles to users in your hierarchy, you can use the following procedures to monitor the compliance status of the Wi-Fi profile:  
  
-   [How to View Compliance Results in the Configuration Manager Console](#BKMK_console)  
  
-   [How to View Compliance Results by Using Reports](#BKMK_Reports)  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_console"></a> How to View Compliance Results in the Configuration Manager Console  
 Use this procedure to view details about the compliance of deployed Wi-Fi profiles in the [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] console.  
  
#### To view compliance results in the Configuration Manager console  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] console, click **Monitoring**.  
  
2.  In the **Monitoring** workspace, click **Deployments**.  
  
3.  In the **Deployments** list, select the Wi-Fi profile deployment for which you want to review compliance information.  
  
4.  You can review summary information about the compliance of the Wi-Fi profile deployment on the main page. To view more detailed information, select the Wi-Fi profile deployment, and then, on the **Home** tab, in the **Deployment** group, click **View Status** to open the **Deployment Status** page.  
  
     The **Deployment Status** page contains the following tabs:  
  
    -   **Compliant:** Displays the compliance of the Wi-Fi profile that is based on the number of affected assets. You can double-click a rule to create a temporary node under the **Users** node in the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, which contains all users that are compliant with this profile. The **Asset Details** pane displays the users that are compliant with the Wi-Fi profile. Double-click a user in the list to display additional information.  
  
        > [!IMPORTANT]  
        >  A Wi-Fi profile is not evaluated if it is not applicable on a client device; however, it is returned as compliant.  
  
    -   **Error:** Displays a list of all errors for the selected Wi-Fi profile deployment that is based on the number of affected assets. You can double-click a rule to create a temporary node under the **Users** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, which contains all users that generated errors with this profile. When you select a user, the **Asset Details** pane displays the users that are affected by the selected issue. Double-click a user in the list to display additional information about the issue.  
  
    -   **Non-Compliant:** Displays a list of all noncompliant rules within the Wi-Fi profile that is based on the number of affected assets. You can double-click a rule to create a temporary node under the **Users** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, which contains all users that are not compliant with this profile. When you select a user, the **Asset Details** pane displays the users that are affected by the selected issue. Double-click a user in the list to display further information about the issue.  
  
    -   **Unknown:** Displays a list of all users that did not report compliance for the selected Wi-Fi profile deployment together with the current client status of the devices.  
  
5.  On the **Deployment Status** page, you can review detailed information about the compliance of the deployed Wi-Fi profile. A temporary node is created under the **Deployments** node that helps you find this information again quickly.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Reports"></a> How to View Compliance Results by Using Reports  
 Compliance settings, which include Wi-Fi profiles in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)], also includes a number of built-in reports that let you monitor information about Wi-Fi profiles. These reports have the report category of **Compliance and Settings Management**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must use a wildcard (%) character when you use the parameters **Device filter** and **User filter** in the compliance settings reports.  
  
 For more information about how to configure reporting in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)], see [Reporting in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Reporting-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).
