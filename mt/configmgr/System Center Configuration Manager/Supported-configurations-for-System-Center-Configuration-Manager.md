# Supported configurations for System Center Configuration Manager
As an on-premises solution, [!INCLUDE[cm6long_md](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] makes use of your servers, clients, network configurations, and additional products like Microsoft Intune, SQL Server and Azure. 

The information in this and the following topics is essential to identifying key configurations and requirements, or limitations, so you can plan, deploy, and maintain a functional [!INCLUDE[cmshort_md](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] deployment.  This information is specific to the infrastructure for [!INCLUDE[cmshort_md](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] sites, hierarchies and managed devices. When a [!INCLUDE[cmshort_md](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] feature or capability requires more specific configurations, that information will be included with the feature specific documentation, and is supplemental to these more general supported configuration details.  

 The products and technologies detailed in the following topics are supported with [!INCLUDE[cmshort_md](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. However, their inclusion in this content does not express an extension of support for any product beyond that products individual support lifecycle. Products that are beyond their support lifecycle are not supported for use with [!INCLUDE[cmshort_md](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].
