# Deploy and manage applications with System Center Configuration Manager
One of the primary reasons many companies use [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] is to manage the multitude of apps that are available today.  
  
 Getting your devices managed by [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] is just the first step in the many tasks you will perform.  
  
 For example, if your company uses Microsoft Word, there are versions available for Windows, iOS, Android, and more. The challenge you face as an IT admin  is to manage the variety of apps available, on many different device and computer platforms with the aim of allowing users to do their work whilst still ensuring the security of your company data.  
  
 Just like with the management of your devices, apps have a lifecycle that takes you from preparation, to deployment, monitoring, updating, and retiring. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] can help you at all stages of this lifecycle.  
  
 In the following sections, you'll discover how to manage your apps on mobile devices and computers through their lifecycle.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  It's easy to get confused by the terms **app**, and **application**. In this library, an **app** is something you install on your mobile device or computer, like Microsoft Word. In [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)], an application is created and deployed to computers and mobile devices. This application might contain more than one version of the same app, that gets installed to the relevant device type.  
>   
>  You'll learn much more about how applications work in the **Get started** section of this guide.  
  
## Get started  
 Before you start working with applications, you need to learn a few concepts covered in this section:prerequisites for application deployment, navigating the **Software Library** workspace of the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, and the different types of apps you can deploy with [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].

## Plan for and configure application management  
 This section covers how to configure the prerequisites for managing applications.  
  
 [Plan for and configure application management in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Plan-for-and-configure-application-management-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md)  
  
## Create and deploy an application  
 In this section, you'll be introduced to the **Create Application wizard** and run through the steps to create a basic [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] application. This will help you to learn the basic flow for creating an application and also give you links to some of the more advanced options you can use. You will then learn how to deploy the application you created.

## Manage and protect apps  
 Before you create, or after you have created an application, there are a wide range of tasks you can use to help you manage applications. For example, you can retire or delete applications, manage the content files associated with the application, manage app configuration and volume license purchase information for some devices and more.  
  
 [Manage and protect apps with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Manage-and-protect-apps-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md)  
  
## Monitor applications  
 [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] provides a number of ways that you can monitor your application deployment and also to help you plan deployments including in-console monitoring, reports, and software metering, which lets you look at how often specified apps are being used in your company, helping you to plan where to invest in app licenses.  
  
 [Monitor applications with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Monitor-applications-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md)  
  
## Update, retire, and uninstall applications  
 Modern apps are often updated regularly. It can be a difficult job to ensure that all of your users are running the latest version of an app. Fortunately, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] provides a simple capability that lets you update or supersede a previously deployed app with a newer version of the same app.  
  
 Additionally, when the apps you deployed to devices are no longer required and you want to uninstall them,[!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] makes this process simple for apps  you manage.
