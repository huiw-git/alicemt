# How to create PFX certificate profiles in System Center Configuration Manager
[!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] allows you to provision personal information exchange (.pfx) files to user’s devices. PFX files can be used to generate user-specific certificates to support encrypted data exchange. PFX certificates can be created within Configuration Manager or imported. With [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)], imported or new PFX certificates can be deployed to iOS, Android, and Windows 10 devices. These files can then be deployed to multiple devices to support user-based PKI communication.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  A step-by-step walkthrough describing this process is available in [How to Create and Deploy PFX Certificate Profiles in Configuration Manager](http://blogs.technet.com/b/karanrustagi/archive/2015/09/01/how-to-create-and-deploy-pfx-certificate-profiles-in-configuration-manager.aspx).  
  
## Create and Deploy Personal Information Exchange (PFX) Certificate Profiles  
  
#### How to create and deploy a Personal Information Exchange (PFX) certificate profile  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] console, click **Assets and Compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Compliance Settings**, expand **Company Resource Access**, and then click **Certificate Profiles**.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Certificate Profile**. The **Create Certificate Profile** wizard opens.  
  
4.  On the **General** page of the **Create Certificate Profile** Wizard, specify the following information:  
  
    -   **Name**: Enter a unique name for the certificate profile. You can use a maximum of 256 characters.  
  
    -   **Description**: Provide a description that gives an overview of the certificate profile and other relevant information that helps to identify it in the [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] console. You can use a maximum of 256 characters.  
  
    -   **Specify the type of certificate profile that you want to create**: Choose one of the following certificate profile types:  
  
        -   **Trusted CA certificate**: Select this certificate profile type if you want to deploy a trusted root certification authority (CA) or intermediate CA certificate to form a certificate chain of trust when the user or device must authenticate another device. For example, the device might be a Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server or a virtual private network (VPN) server. You must also configure a trusted CA certificate profile before you can create a SCEP certificate profile. In this case, the trusted CA certificate must be the trusted root certificate for the CA that will issue the certificate to the user or device.  
  
        -   **Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) settings**: Select this certificate profile type if you want to request a certificate for a user or device, by using the Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol and the Network Device Enrollment Service role service.  
  
        -   **Personal Information Exchange – PKCS #12 (PFX) settings – import**: Select this to import a PFX certificate.  
  
5.  In the **Certificate Properties** window of the **Create Certificate Profile** wizard, specify where the PFX certificate will be stored on targeted devices.  
  
    -   **Install to Trusted Platform Module (TPM) if present**  
  
    -   **Install to Trusted Platform Module (TPM), otherwise fail**  
  
    -   **Install to Software Key Storage Provider**  
  
     Click **Next**.  
  
6.  In the **Supported Platforms** window of the **Create Certificate Profile** wizard, specify which operating systems or platforms that can receive the imported PFX file.  
  
    -   **Windows 10**  
  
    -   **iPhone**  
  
    -   **iPad**  
  
    -   **Android**  
  
7.  Click **Next**, review the **Summary** page, and then close the wizard.  
  
8.  The certificate profile containing the PFX file is now available from the **Certificate Profiles** workspace. In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace go **Compliance Settings** > **Company Resource Access** > **Certificate Profiles** and right-click to deploy the new certificate to User collections.  
  
9. Using the SDK for Windows 8.1 available from the Download Center ([http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=613525](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=613525), deploy a Create PFX Script. The Create PFX Script added in Configuration Manager 2012 SP2 adds an SMS_ClientPfxCertificate class to the SDK. This class includes the following methods:  
  
    -   ImportForUser  
  
    -   DeleteForUser  
  
     Sample script:  
  
    ```  
    $EncryptedPfxBlob = "<blob>"  
    $Password = "abc"  
    $ProfileName = "PFX_Profile_Name"  
    $UserName = "ComputerName\Administrator"  
  
    #New pfx  
    $WMIConnection = ([WMIClass]"\\nksccm\root\SMS\Site_MDM:SMS_ClientPfxCertificate")  
        $NewEntry = $WMIConnection.psbase.GetMethodParameters("ImportForUser")  
        $NewEntry.EncryptedPfxBlob = $EncryptedPfxBlob  
        $NewEntry.Password = $Password  
        $NewEntry.ProfileName = $ProfileName  
        $NewEntry.UserName = $UserName  
    $Resource = $WMIConnection.psbase.InvokeMethod("ImportForUser",$NewEntry,$null)  
  
    ```  
  
     The following script variables must be modified for your script:  
  
    -   <blob\> = The PFX base64-encrypted blob  
  
    -   $Password = The password for the PFX file  
  
    -   $ProfileName = The name of the PFX profile  
  
    -   ComputerName = Name of host computer
