# How to deploy clients to Macs in System Center Configuration Manager
Client installation and management for Mac computers in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] requires public key infrastructure (PKI) certificates. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] can request and install a user client certificate by using Microsoft Certificate Services with an enterprise certification authority (CA) and the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] enrollment point and enrollment proxy point site system roles. Or, you can request and install a computer certificate independently from [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] if the certificate meets the requirements for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. PKI certificates secure the communication between the Mac computers and the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] site by using mutual authentication and encrypted data transfers.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] Mac clients always perform certificate revocation checking; unlike [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] clients that run on Windows, you cannot disable this certificate revocation list (CRL) checking function.  
>   
>  If Mac clients cannot confirm the certificate revocation status for a server certificate because they cannot locate the CRL, they will not be able to successfully connect to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] site systems, such as management points and distribution points. Especially for Mac clients in a different forest to the issuing certification authority, check your CRL design to ensure that Mac clients can locate and connect to a CRL distribution point (CDP) for connecting site system servers.  
  
 Before you install the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client on a Mac computer, decide how to install the client certificate:  
  
-   Use [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] enrollment by using the CMEnroll tool and follow the steps in the next section of this topic. The enrollment process does not support automatic certificate renewal so you must re-enroll Mac computers before the installed certificate expires.  
  
-   Use a certificate request and installation method that is independent from [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. For this installation method, see the [Use a certificate request and installation method that is independent from Configuration Manager](#BKMK_ManualCertifcateInstallation) section in this topic.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For more information about the Mac client certificate requirement and other PKI certificates that are required to support Mac computers, see [PKI certificate requirements for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/PKI-certificate-requirements-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
 Mac clients are automatically assigned to the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] site that manages them. Mac clients install as Internet-only clients, even if communication is restricted to the intranet. This client configuration means that they will communicate with the site system roles (management points and distribution points) in their assigned site when you configure these site system roles to allow client connections from the Internet. Mac computers do not communicate with site system roles outside their assigned site.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] Mac client cannot be used to connect to a management point that is configured to use a database replica. For information about database replicas, see [Database replicas for management points for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Database-replicas-for-management-points-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
 Use the following sections to install, configure, and manage Mac computers for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]:  
  
-   [Steps to install and configure the client for Macs](#InstallSteps)  
  
-   [Uninstalling the Mac client](#uninstallMacClient)  
  
-   [Renewing the Mac client certificate](#BKMK_Renew)  
  
-   [Use a certificate request and installation method that is independent from Configuration Manager](#BKMK_ManualCertifcateInstallation)  
  
##  <a name="InstallSteps"></a> Steps to install and configure the client for Macs  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Before you perform these steps, make sure that your Mac computer meets the prerequisites. For more information, see [On-premises mobile device management](../Topic/Supported%20operating%20systems%20for%20sites%20and%20clients%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager.md#bkmk_OnpremOS) in [Supported operating systems for sites and clients for System Center Configuration Manager](../Topic/Supported%20operating%20systems%20for%20sites%20and%20clients%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager.md).  
  
### Step 1: Deploy a web server certificate to site system servers  
 These site systems might already have this certificate for other [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] clients. If not, deploy a web server certificate to the following computers that hold the following site system roles:  
  
-   Management point  
  
-   Distribution point  
  
-   Enrollment point  
  
-   Enrollment proxy point  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  The web server certificate must contain the Internet FQDN that is specified in the site system properties.  
>   
>  This does not mean that the server must be accessible from the Internet to support Mac computers. If you do not require Internet-based client management, you can specify the intranet FQDN value for the Internet FQDN.  
  
 For an example deployment that creates and installs this web server certificate, see the [Deploying the Web Server Certificate for Site Systems that Run IIS](../Topic/Step-by-step%20example%20deployment%20of%20the%20PKI%20certificates%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager:%20Windows%20Server%202008%20Certification%20Authority.md#BKMK_webserver2008_cm2012).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Make sure that you specify the site systemâ€™s Internet FQDN value in the web server certificate for the management point, the distribution point, and the enrollment proxy point.  
  
### Step 2: Deploy a client authentication certificate to site system servers  
 These site systems might already have this certificate for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] functionality. If not, deploy a client authentication certificate to the following computers that hold the following site system roles:  
  
-   Management point  
  
-   Distribution point  
  
 For an example deployment that creates and installs the client certificate for management points, see the [Deploying the Client Certificate for Windows Computers](../Topic/Step-by-step%20example%20deployment%20of%20the%20PKI%20certificates%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager:%20Windows%20Server%202008%20Certification%20Authority.md#BKMK_client2008_cm2012)  
  
 For an example deployment that creates and installs the client certificate for distribution points, see the [Deploying the Client Certificate for Distribution Points](../Topic/Step-by-step%20example%20deployment%20of%20the%20PKI%20certificates%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager:%20Windows%20Server%202008%20Certification%20Authority.md#BKMK_clientdistributionpoint2008_cm2012).  
  
### Step 3: Prepare the client certificate template for Macs  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  To run the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] enrollment tool, you must have an Active Directory user account.  
  
 The certificate template must have **Read** and **Enroll** permissions for the user account that will enroll the certificate on the Mac computer.  
  
 See [Deploying the Client Certificate for Mac Computers](../Topic/Step-by-step%20example%20deployment%20of%20the%20PKI%20certificates%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager:%20Windows%20Server%202008%20Certification%20Authority.md#BKMK_MacClient_SP1).  
  
### Step 4: Configure the management point and distribution point  
 Configure management points for the following options:  
  
-   HTTPS  
  
-   Allow client connections from the Internet  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This configuration value is required to manage Mac computers. However, it does not mean that site system servers must be accessible from the Internet.  
  
-   Allow mobile devices and Mac computers to use this management point  
  
 Although distribution points are not required to install the client on Mac computers, you must configure distribution points to allow client connections from the Internet if you want to deploy software to these Mac computers after the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client is installed.  
  
 This procedure configures existing management points and distribution points to support Mac computers. Before you start this procedure, make sure that the site system server that runs the management point and distribution point is configured with an Internet FQDN. If these site system servers will not support Internet-based client management, you can specify the intranet FQDN as the Internet FQDN value. In addition, these site system roles must be in a primary site.  
  
##### To configure management points and distribution points to support Macs  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Administration**.  
  
2.  In the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, select **Servers and Site System Roles**, and then select the server that holds the site system roles to configure.  
  
3.  In the details pane, right-click **Management point**, click **Role Properties**, and in the **Management Point Properties** dialog box, configure the following options, and then click **OK**:  
  
    1.  Select **HTTPS**.  
  
    2.  Select **Allow Internet-only client connections** or **Allow intranet and Internet client connections**. These options require that an Internet FQDN is specified in the site system properties, even if the site system server will not be accessible from the Internet.  
  
    3.  Select **Allow mobile devices and Mac computers to use this management point**.  
  
4.  In the details pane, right-click **Distribution point**, click **Role Properties**, and in the **Distribution Point Properties** dialog box, configure the following options, and then click **OK**:  
  
    -   Select **HTTPS**.  
  
    -   Select **Allow Internet-only client connections** or **Allow intranet and Internet client connections**. These options require that an Internet FQDN is specified in the site system properties, even if the site system server will not be accessible from the Internet.  
  
    -   Click **Import certificate**, browse to the exported client distribution point certificate file, and then specify the password.  
  
5.  Repeat steps 2 through 4 in this procedure for all management points and distribution points in primary sites that you will use with Mac computers.  
  
### Step 5: Configure the enrollment proxy point and the enrollment point  
 You must install both these site system roles in the same site but you do not have to install them on the same site system server, or in the same Active Directory forest.  
  
 For more information about site system role placement and considerations, see  [Site system roles](../System Center Configuration Manager/Plan-for-site-system-servers-and-site-system-roles-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#bkmk_planroles) in [Plan for site system servers and site system roles for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Plan-for-site-system-servers-and-site-system-roles-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
 These procedures configure the site system roles to support Mac computers. Choose one of these procedures, depending on whether you will install a new site system server to support Mac computers or use an existing site system server:

7.  On the **Enrollment Point Settings** page, review the settings and make any changes that you require, and then click **Next**.  
  
8.  Complete the wizard.  
  
### Step 6: Optional: Install the reporting services point  
 Install the reporting services point if you want to run reports for Mac computers.  
  
 For more information about how to install and configure the reporting services point, see [Configuring reporting in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Configuring-reporting-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
### Step 7: Configure client settings for enrollment  
 You must use the default client settings to configure enrollment for Mac computers; you cannot use custom client settings.  
  
 For more information about client settings, see [About client settings in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/About-client-settings-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
 This step is required for [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to request and install the certificate on the Mac computer.  
  
##### To configure the default client settings for Configuration Manager to enroll certificates for Macs  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Administration**.  
  
2.  In the **Administration** workspace, click **Client Settings**.  
  
3.  Click **Default Client Settings**.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  You cannot use a custom client setting for the enrollment configuration; you must use the default client settings.  
  
4.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Properties** group, click **Properties**.  
  
5.  Select the **Enrollment** section, and then configure the following user settings:  
  
    1.  **Allow users to enroll mobile devices and Mac computers:Yes**  
  
    2.  **Enrollment profile:** Click **Set Profile**.  
  
6.  In the **Mobile Device Enrollment Profile** dialog box, click **Create**.  
  
7.  In the **Create Enrollment Profile** dialog box, enter a name for this enrollment profile, and then configure the **Management site code**. Select the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] primary site that contains the management points that will manage the Mac computers.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you cannot select the site, check that at least one management point in the site is configured to support mobile devices.  
  
8.  Click **Add**.  
  
9. In the **Add Certification Authority for Mobile Devices** dialog box, select the certification authority (CA) server that will issue certificates to Mac computers, and then click **OK**.  
  
10. In the **Create Enrollment Profile** dialog box, select the Mac computer certificate template that you created in Step 3, and then click **OK**.  
  
11. Click **OK** to close the **Enrollment Profile** dialog box, and then click **OK** to close the **Default Client Settings** dialog box.  
  
    > [!TIP]  
    >  If you want to change the client policy interval, use the **Client policy polling interval** client setting in the **Client Policy** client setting group.  
  
 All users will be configured with these settings when they next download client policy. To initiate policy retrieval for a single client, see [Initiate Policy Retrieval for a Configuration Manager Client](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-manage-clients-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_PolicyRetrieval).  
  
 In addition to the enrollment client settings, ensure that you have configured the following [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client device settings:  
  
-   **Hardware inventory**: Enable and configure this client setting if you want to collect hardware inventory from Mac and Windows client computers. For more information, see [How to extend hardware inventory in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-extend-hardware-inventory-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
-   **Compliance settings**: Enable and configure this client setting if you want to evaluate and remediate settings on Mac and Windows client computers. For more information, see [Planning and configuring compliance settings in Configuration Manager](assetId:///9ea20b01-676a-4cc2-b328-0098a41b202e).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For more information about [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client settings, see [How to configure client settings in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-configure-client-settings-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
### Step 8: Download the client source files for Macs  
 You must download and install the following programs before you can install and manage the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client on Macs:  
  
-   **Ccmsetup**: Use this application to install the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client on Mac computers in your organization.  
  
-   **CMDiagnostics**: Use this tool to collect diagnostic information related to the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client on Mac computers in your organization.  
  
-   **CMUninstall**: Use this tool to uninstall the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client from Mac computers in your organization.  
  
-   **CMAppUtil**: Use this tool to convert Apple application packages into a format that can be deployed as a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] application.  
  
-   **CMEnroll**: Use this tool to request and install the client certificate for a Mac computer so that you can then install the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When you install a new client for Mac computers, you might have to also install [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] updates to reflect the new client information in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console. For the latest information, see [On-premises mobile device management](../Topic/Supported%20operating%20systems%20for%20sites%20and%20clients%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager.md#bkmk_OnpremOS) in [Supported operating systems for sites and clients for System Center Configuration Manager](../Topic/Supported%20operating%20systems%20for%20sites%20and%20clients%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager.md).  
  
##### To download and install the Mac OS X client files  
  
1.  Download the Mac OS X client file package, **ConfigmgrMacClient.msi**, and save it to a computer that runs Windows.  
  
     This file is not supplied on the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] installation media. You can download this file from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525184).  
  
2.  On the Windows computer, run the **ConfigmgrMacClient.msi** file that you just downloaded to extract the Mac client package, Macclient.dmg to a folder on the local disk (by default **C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\System Center 2012 Configuration Manager Mac Client\\**).  
  
3.  Copy the Macclient.dmg file to a folder on the Mac computer.  
  
4.  On the Mac computer, run the Macclient.dmg file that you just downloaded to extract the files to a folder on the local disk.  
  
5.  In the folder, ensure that the files Ccmsetup and CMClient.pkg are extracted and that a folder named Tools is created that contains the CMDiagnostics,  CMUninstall, CMAppUtil and CMEnroll tools.  
  
### Step 9: Install the client and then enroll the client certificate on the Mac  
 This procedure installs the client and then uses the CMEnroll tool to request and install the client certificate for a Mac computer so that you can then manage this computer by using [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
 You can enroll the client by using the Mac Computer Enrollment wizard without having to use the CMEnroll tool. For more information, see the procedure below.  
  
##### To install the client and enroll the certificate by using the CMEnroll tool  
  
1.  On the Mac computer, navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents of the Macclient.dmg file that you downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center.  
  
2.  Enter the following command-line: **sudo ./ccmsetup**  
  
3.  Wait until you see the **Completed installation** message. Although the installer displays a message that you must restart now, do not restart now but continue to the next step.  
  
4.  From the Tools folder on the Mac computer, type the following: **sudo ./CMEnroll -s <enrollment_proxy_server_name> -ignorecertchainvalidation -u <'user name'>**  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  After the client installs, the Mac Computer Enrollment wizard opens to help you enroll the Mac computer. To enroll the client by this method, see [To enroll the client by using the Mac Computer Enrollment Wizard](#BKMK_EnrollR2) in this topic.  
  
     You are then prompted to type the password for the Active Directory user account.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  When you enter this command, you are actually prompted for two passwords: The first prompt is for the super user account to run the command. The second prompt is for the Active Directory user account. The prompts look identical, so make sure that you specify them in the correct sequence.  
  
     The user name can be in the following formats:  
  
    -   'domain\nameâ€™. For example: 'contoso\mnorth'  
  
    -   'user@domain'. For example: 'mnorth@contoso.com'  
  
     The user name and corresponding password must match an Active Directory user account that is granted Read and Enroll permissions on the Mac client certificate template.  
  
     Example: If the enrollment proxy point server is named **server02.contoso.com**, and a user name of **contoso\mnorth** has been granted permissions for the Mac client certificate template, type the following: **sudo ./CMEnroll -s server02.contoso.com â€“ignorecertchainvalidation -u 'contoso\mnorth'**  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  If the username contains any of the characters **<>"+=,** then enrollment will fail.  
    >   
    >  To fix this problem, obtain an out-of-band certificate with a username that does not contain these characters.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  For a more seamless user experience, you can script the installation steps and commands so that users only have to supply their user name and password.  
  
5.  Wait until you see the **Successfully enrolled** message.  
  
6.  To limit the enrolled certificate to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)], on the Mac computer, open a terminal window and make the following changes:  
  
    1.  Enter the command **sudo /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\ Access.app/Contents/MacOS/Keychain\ Access**  
  
    2.  In the **Keychain Access** dialog box, in the **Keychains** section, click **System**, and then, in the **Category** section, click **Keys**.  
  
    3.  Expand the keys to view the client certificates. When you have identified the certificate with a private key that you have just installed, double-click the key.  
  
    4.  On the **Access Control** tab, select **Confirm before allowing access**.  
  
    5.  Browse to **/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/CCM**, select **CCMClient**, and then click **Add**.  
  
    6.  Click **Save Changes** and close the **Keychain Access** dialog box.  
  
7.  Restart the Mac computer.  
  
 Verify that the client installation is successful by opening the **Configuration Manager** item in **System Preferences** on the Mac computer. You can also update and view the **All Systems** collection to confirm that the Mac computer now appears in this collection as a managed client.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  To help troubleshoot any problems with the Mac client, you can use the CMDiagnostics program that is included with the Mac OS X client package to collect the following diagnostic information:  
>   
>  -   A list of running processes  
> -   The Mac OS X operating system version  
> -   Mac OS X crash reports relating to the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client including **CCM\*.crash** and **System Preference.crash**.  
> -   The Bill of Materials (BOM) file and property list (.plist) file created by the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client installation.  
> -   The contents of the folder /Library/Application Support/Microsoft/CCM/Logs.  
>   
>  The information collected by CmDiagnostics is added to a zip file that is saved to the desktop of the computer and is named cmdiag-*<hostname\>***-***<date and time\>*.zip.  
  
####  <a name="BKMK_EnrollR2"></a> To enroll the client by using the Mac Computer Enrollment Wizard  
  
1.  After you have finished installing the client the Computer Enrollment wizard opens. Click **Next** to continue past the welcome page.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the wizard does not open, or if you accidentally close the wizard, click **Enroll** from the **Configuration Manager** preference page to open the wizard.  
  
2.  On the next page of the wizard, specify the following information:  
  
    -   **User name** - The user name can be in the following formats:  
  
        -   'domain\nameâ€™. For example: 'contoso\mnorth'  
  
        -   'user@domain'. For example: 'mnorth@contoso.com'  
  
            > [!IMPORTANT]  
            >  When you use an email address to populate the **User name** field, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] automatically uses the domain name of the email address and the default name of the enrollment proxy point server to populate the **Server name** field. If this domain name and server name do not match the name of the enrollment proxy point server, you must advise your users of the correct name to use, so that they can enter this when enrolling their Mac computers.  
  
         The user name and corresponding password must match an Active Directory user account that is granted Read and Enroll permissions on the Mac client certificate template.  
  
    -   **Password** â€“ Enter a corresponding password for the user name specified.  
  
    -   **Server name** â€“ Enter the name of the enrollment proxy point server.  
  
3.  Click **Next** to continue, and then complete the wizard.  
  
##  <a name="uninstallMacClient"></a> Uninstalling the Mac client  
 If you want to uninstall the Mac client, use the CMUninstall script that is provided with the Mac client files you downloaded from the web. Use the following procedure to help you uninstall the Configuration Manager client from Mac computers.  
  
#### To uninstall the Mac client  
  
1.  On a Mac computer, open a terminal window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents of the macclient.dmg file that you downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center.  
  
2.  Navigate to the Tools folder and enter the following command-line:  
  
     **./CMUninstall -c**  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  The **â€“c** property instructs the client uninstall to also remove and client crash logs and log files. This is optional, but a best practice to help avoid confusion if you later reinstall the client.  
  
3.  If required, manually remove the client authentication certificate that [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] was using, or revoke it. CMUnistall does not remove or revoke this certificate.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Renew"></a> Renewing the Mac client certificate  
 Use one of the following methods to renew the Mac client certificate:  
  
-   [Renewing the Mac client certificate by using the Renew Certificate Wizard](#BKMK_UI)  
  
-   [Renewing the Mac client certificate manually](#BKMK_Man)  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_UI"></a> Renewing the Mac client certificate by using the Renew Certificate Wizard  
 Use the following procedure to configure and use the Renew Certificate Wizard in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
##### To renew the Mac client certificate by using the Renew Certificate Wizard  
  
1.  Configure the following values in the ccmclient.plist file that control when the Renew Certificate Wizard opens:  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  You must configure these values as strings. If you configure the values as integer data types (by using the **â€“int** property), they will not be read.  
  
    -   **RenewalPeriod1** â€“ Specifies, in seconds, the first renewal period in which users can renew the certificate. The default value is 3,888,000 seconds (45 days).  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  If **RenewalPeriod1** is configured and is greater than or equal to 300 seconds, the configured value will be used.  If the configured value is greater than 0 and less than 300 seconds, the default value of 45 days will be used.  
  
    -   **RenewalPeriod2** â€“ Specifies, in seconds, the second renewal period in which users can renew the certificate. The default value is 259,200 seconds (3 days).  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  If **RenewalPeriod2** is configured and is greater than or equal to 300 seconds and is less than or equal to **RenewalPeriod1**, the configured value will be used. If **RenewalPeriod1** is greater than 3 days, a value of 3 days will be used for **RenewalPeriod2**.  If **RenewalPeriod1** is less than 3 days, then **RenewalPeriod2** is set to the same value as **RenewalPeriod1**.  
  
    -   **RenewalReminderInterval1** â€“ Specifies, in seconds, the frequency at which the Renew Certificate Wizard will be displayed to users during the first renewal period. The default value is 86,400 seconds (1 day).  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  If **RenewalReminderInterval1** is greater than 300 seconds and less than the value configured for **RenewalPeriod1**, then the configured value will be used. Otherwise, the default value of 1 day will be used.  
  
    -   **RenewalReminderInterval2** â€“ Specifies, in seconds the frequency at which the Renew Certificate Wizard will be displayed to users during the second renewal period. The default value is 28,800 seconds (8 hours).  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  If **RenewalReminderInterval2** is greater than 300 seconds, less   than or equal to **RenewalReminderInterval1** and less than or equal to **RenewalPeriod2**, then the configured value will be used. Otherwise, a value of 8 hours will be used.  
  
     **Example:** If the values are left as their defaults, 45 days before the certificate expires, the wizard will open every 24 hours.  Within 3 days of the certificate expiring, the wizard will open every 8 hours.  
  
     **Example:** Use the following command line, or a script, to set the first renewal period to 20 days.  
  
     `sudo defaults write com.microsoft.ccmclient RenewalPeriod1 1728000`  
  
2.  When the Renew Certificate Wizard opens, the **User name** and **Server name** fields will typically be pre-populated and the user will only need to enter a password to renew the certificate.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If the wizard does not open, or if you accidentally close the wizard, click **Renew** from the **Configuration Manager** preference page to open the wizard.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_Man"></a> Renewing the Mac client certificate manually  
 A typical validity period for the Mac client certificate is 1 year. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] does not automatically renew the user certificate that it requests during enrollment, so you must use the following procedure to renew the certificate manually.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If the certificate expires, you must uninstall, reinstall and then re-enroll the Mac client.  
  
 This procedure removes the SMSID, which is required to request a new certificate for the same Mac computer. After the new certificate is requested, it is automatically used by [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When you remove and replace the client SMSID, any stored client history such as inventory is deleted after you delete the client from the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console.  
  
##### To renew the Mac client certificate manually  
  
1.  Create a device collection for the Mac computers that must renew the user certificates, and then add the Mac computers to the collection.  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    >  [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] does not monitor the validity period of the certificate that it enrolls for Mac computers. You must monitor this independently from [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to identify the Mac computers to add to this collection.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, start the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**.  
  
3.  On the **General** page of the wizard, specify the following information:  
  
    -   **Name:Remove SMSID for Mac**  
  
    -   **Type:Mac OS X**  
  
4.  On the **Supported Platforms** page of the wizard, ensure that all Mac OS X versions are selected.  
  
5.  On the **Settings** page of the wizard, click **New** and then, in the **Create Setting** dialog box, specify the following information:  
  
    -   **Name:Remove SMSID for Mac**  
  
    -   **Setting type:Script**  
  
    -   **Data type:String**  
  
6.  In the **Create Setting** dialog box, for **Discovery script**, click **Add script** to specify a script that discovers Mac computers with an SMSID configured.  
  
7.  In the **Edit Discovery Script** dialog box, enter the following Shell Script:  
  
    ```  
    defaults read com.microsoft.ccmclient SMSID  
    ```  
  
8.  Click **OK** to close the **Edit Discovery Script** dialog box.  
  
9. In the **Create Setting** dialog box, for **Remediation script (optional)**, click **Add script** to specify a script that removes the SMSID when it is found on Mac computers.  
  
10. In the **Create Remediation Script** dialog box, enter the following Shell Script:  
  
    ```  
    defaults delete com.microsoft.ccmclient SMSID  
    ```  
  
11. Click **OK** to close the **Create Remediation Script** dialog box.  
  
12. On the **Compliance Rules** page of the wizard, click **New**, and then in the **Create Rule** dialog box, specify the following information:  
  
    -   **Name:Remove SMSID for Mac**  
  
    -   **Selected setting:** Click **Browse** and then select the discovery script that you specified previously.  
  
    -   In **the following values** field, enter **The domain/default pair of (com.microsoft.ccmclient, SMSID) does not exist**.  
  
    -   Enable the option **Run the specified remediation script when this setting is noncompliant**.  
  
13. Complete the Create Configuration Item Wizard.  
  
14. Create a configuration baseline that contains the configuration item that you have just created and deploy this to the device collection that you created in step 1.  
  
     For more information about how to create and deploy configuration baselines, see [How to create configuration baselines in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-create-configuration-baselines-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) and [How to deploy configuration baselines in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-deploy-configuration-baselines-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
15. On Mac computers that have the SMSID removed, run the following command to install a new certificate:  
  
    ```  
    sudo ./CMEnroll -s <enrollment_proxy_server_name> -ignorecertchainvalidation -u <'user name'>  
    ```  
  
     When prompted, provide the password for the super user account to run the command and then the password for the Active Directory user account.  
  
16. To limit the enrolled certificate to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)], on the Mac computer, open a terminal window and make the following changes:  
  
    1.  Enter the command **sudo /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\ Access.app/Contents/MacOS/Keychain\ Access**  
  
    2.  In the **Keychain Access** dialog box, in the **Keychains** section, click **System**, and then, in the **Category** section, click **Keys**.  
  
    3.  Expand the keys to view the client certificates. When you have identified the certificate with a private key that you have just installed, double-click the key.  
  
    4.  On the **Access Control** tab, select **Confirm before allowing access**.  
  
    5.  Browse to **/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/CCM**, select **CCMClient**, and then click **Add**.  
  
    6.  Click **Save Changes** and close the **Keychain Access** dialog box.  
  
17. Restart the Mac computer.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_ManualCertifcateInstallation"></a> Use a certificate request and installation method that is independent from Configuration Manager  
 When you do not use [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] enrollment but instead, request and install the client certificate independently from [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)], the configuration steps are slightly different:  
  
1.  Perform steps 1, 2, 4, 6 (optional), and 8.  
  
2.  Do not perform steps 3, 5, 7, and 9.  
  
3.  Install the client by using the following instructions.  
  
#### To install the client certificate independently from Configuration Manager and install the client  
  
1.  To install the client certificate independently from [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)], use the instructions that accompany your chosen certificate deployment method to request and install the client certificate on the Mac computer.  
  
2.  Navigate to the folder where you extracted the contents of the macclient.dmg file that you downloaded from the Microsoft Download Center.  
  
3.  Enter the following command-line: **sudo ./ccmsetup â€“MP <management point Internet FQDN\> -SubjectName <certificate subject value\>**  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The certificate subject value is case-sensitive, so type it exactly as it appears in the certificate details.  
  
     Example: If the Internet FQDN in the site system properties is **server03.contoso.com** and the Mac client certificate has the FQDN of **mac12.contoso.com** as a common name in the certificate subject, type: **sudo ./ccmsetup â€“MP server03.contoso.com â€“SubjectName mac12.contoso.com**  
  
4.  Wait until you see the **Completed installation** message and then restart the Mac computer.  
  
5.  To make sure that this certificate is accessible to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)], on the Mac computer, open a terminal window and make the following changes:  
  
    1.  Enter the command **sudo /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\ Access.app/Contents/MacOS/Keychain\ Access**  
  
    2.  In the **Keychain Access** dialog box, in the **Keychains** section, click **System**, and then, in the **Category** section, click **Keys**.  
  
    3.  Expand the keys to view the client certificates. When you have identified the certificate with a private key that you have just installed, double-click the key.  
  
    4.  On the **Access Control** tab, select **Confirm before allowing access**.  
  
    5.  Browse to **/Library/Application Support/Microsoft/CCM**, select **CCMClient**, and then click **Add**.  
  
    6.  Click **Save Changes** and close the **Keychain Access** dialog box.  
  
6.  If you have more than one certificate that contains the same subject value, you must specify the certificate serial number to identify the certificate that you want to use for the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client. To do this, use the following command: **sudo defaults write com.microsoft.ccmclient SerialNumber -data "<serial number\>"**.  
  
     For example: **sudo defaults write com.microsoft.ccmclient SerialNumber -data "17D4391A00000003DB"**  
  
 Verify that the client installation is successful by opening the **Configuration Manager** item in **System Preferences** on the Mac computer. You can also update and view the **All Systems** collection to confirm that the Mac computer now appears in this collection as a managed client.  
  
### Renewing the Mac client certificate  
 Use the following procedure before you renew the computer certificate on Mac computers.  
  
 This procedure removes the SMSID, which is required for the client to use a new or renewed certificate on the Mac computer.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When you remove and replace the client SMSID, any stored client history such as inventory is deleted after you delete the client from the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console.  
  
##### To renew the Mac client certificate  
  
1.  Create a device collection for the Mac computers that must renew the computer certificates, and then add the Mac computers to the collection.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, start the **Create Configuration Item Wizard**.  
  
3.  On the **General** page of the wizard, specify the following information:  
  
    -   **Name:Remove SMSID for Mac**

13. Complete the Create Configuration Item Wizard.  
  
14. Create a configuration baseline that contains the configuration item that you have just created and deploy this to the device collection that you created in step 1.  
  
     For more information about how to create and deploy configuration baselines, see [How to create configuration baselines in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-create-configuration-baselines-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
15. After you have installed a new certificate on Mac computers that have the SMSID removed, run the following command to configure the client to use the new certificate:  
  
    ```  
    sudo defaults write com.microsoft.ccmclient SubjectName â€“string <Subject_Name_of_New_Certificate>  
    ```  
  
16. If you have more than one certificate that contains the same subject value, you must then specify the certificate serial number to identify the certificate that you want to use for the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client. To do this, use the following command: **sudo defaults write com.microsoft.ccmclient SerialNumber -data "<serial number\>"**.  
  
     For example: **sudo defaults write com.microsoft.ccmclient SerialNumber -data "17D4391A00000003DB"**  
  
17. Restart the Mac computer.
