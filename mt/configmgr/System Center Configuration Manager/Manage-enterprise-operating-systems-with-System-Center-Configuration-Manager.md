# Manage enterprise operating systems with System Center Configuration Manager
Operating system deployment provides [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] administrative users with a tool for creating operating system images that they can deploy to computers that are managed by [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] and to unmanaged computers by using bootable media such as a CD set, DVD, or USB flash drives. The operating system image, in a Windows Imaging Format (WIM) format file, contains the required version of a Windows operating system and any line-of-business applications that have to be installed on the computer.  
  
 With operating system deployment, you can perform the following functions:  
  
-   Capture an image of the operating system that you want to deploy.  
  
-   Capture and restore user state by using the User State Migration Tool (USMT).  
  
-   Deploy the operating system image to a collection of computers.  
  
-   Upgrade an operating system to Windows 10.  
  
-   Create task sequences that perform multiple actions on a computer at the command-line level that do not require user intervention.
