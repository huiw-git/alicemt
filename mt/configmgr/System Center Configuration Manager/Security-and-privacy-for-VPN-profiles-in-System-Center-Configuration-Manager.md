## Privacy Information for VPN Profiles  
 You can use VPN profiles to configure client devices to connect to VPN servers and to evaluate whether those devices become compliant after the profiles are applied. Compliance information is sent to the site server by the management point and stored in the site database. The information is encrypted when devices send it to the management point, but it is not stored in encrypted format in the site database. Information is retained in the database until the site maintenance task **Delete Aged Configuration Management Data** deletes it every 90 days. You can configure the deletion interval. Compliance information is not sent to Microsoft.  
  
 By default, devices do not evaluate VPN profiles. In addition, you must configure the VPN profiles, and then deploy them to users.  
  
 Before you configure VPN profiles, consider your privacy requirements.
