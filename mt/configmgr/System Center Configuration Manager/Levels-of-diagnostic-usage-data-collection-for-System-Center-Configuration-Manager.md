# Levels of diagnostic usage data collection for System Center Configuration Manager
[!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] collects three levels of diagnostics and usage data: **Basic**, **Enhanced**, and **Full**. By default, this feature is set at the Enhanced level. The following sections provide additional detail of what data is collected by each level.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] does not collect site codes or sites names, IP addresses, user or computer names, physical addresses, or email addresses on the Basic or Enhanced levels. Any collection of this information on the Full level is not purposeful (potentially included in advanced diagnostic information like log files or memory snapshots) and will not be used by Microsoft to identify you, contact you, or for advertising purposes.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_change"></a> How to change the level  
 Administrators with a role-based administrative scope that includes the **Modify** permissions on the **Site** object class can change the level of data collected in the Diagnostics and Usage Data settings in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_level1"></a> Level 1 - Basic  
 The Basic level includes data about your hierarchy and is required to help improve your installation or upgrade experience, as well as help determine which [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] updates are applicable for your hierarchy.  
  
 Beginning with [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] version 1511, this level includes the following:  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] version 1602 introduces a few changes to the data that is collected for this level. This topic will update with these details as soon as they are available.  
  
-   Setup Information (build, install type, language packs, features you enabled, update pack deployment status and errors)  
  
-   Database performance metrics (replication processing information, top SQL Server stored procedures by processor and disk usage)

-   Basic site system server information (site system roles used, Internet and SSL status, operating system, processors, physical or virtual machine)  
  
-   Basic user discovery statistics (user discovery count, minimum/maximum/average group sizes)

-   Telemetry stats (when run, runtime, errors)  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_level2"></a> Level 2 - Enhanced

This level does not collect object names (sites, users, computer, or objects), details of security related objects, or vulnerabilities like counts of systems requiring software updates.
