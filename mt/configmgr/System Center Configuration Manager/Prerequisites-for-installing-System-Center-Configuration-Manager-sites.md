# Prerequisites for installing System Center Configuration Manager sites

The following sections provide details about the different prerequisites that are required to install the different types of [!INCLUDE[cm6long_md](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] sites.



## Primary sites and the central administration site
The following prerequisites apply to installing a central administration site as the first site of a hierarchy, a stand-alone primary, or child primary site. If you are installing a central administration site as part of a hierarchy expansion scenario, see [Expanding a stand-alone primary site](../System Center Configuration Manager/Prerequisites-for-installing-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-sites.md#bkmk_expand
) in this topic. 

####  <a name="bkmk_PrereqPri"></a> Prerequisites to install a primary site or central administration site  
  
-   The user who will install the site must have the following permissions:  
  
    -   **Local Administrator** on the site server computer  
  
    -   **Local Administrator** on each computer that will host the **site database** or an instance of the **SMS_Provider** for the site  
  
    -   **Sysadmin** on the instance of SQL Server that host the site database  
  
        > [!IMPORTANT]  
        >  After setup completes, both the user account that runs setup and the site server computer account must retain sysadmin rights to SQL Server. It is not supported to remove the sysadmin rights from these accounts.  
  
-   When installing a primary site, the following additional permissions are needed:  
    -  **Local Administrator** on additional computers where you will install the initial management point and distribution point, if not on the site server.  
  
-   When installing a new child primary site below a central administration site, the following additional permissions are needed:  
  
    -   **Local Administrator** on the computer that hosts the central administration site  
  
    -   Role-based administration permissions within [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] that are equivalent to the security role of **Infrastructure Administrator** or **Full Administrator**.  
  
-   You must use the correct install media (source files), and run Setup from that location. For information about the correct source files to use to install different sites, see [Options for installing different types of sites](../System Center Configuration Manager/Prepare-to-install-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-sites.md#bkmk_options), in the [Prepare to install sites](../System Center Configuration Manager/Prepare-to-install-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-sites.md) topic.

-   The site server computer must have access to updated Setup files from Microsoft: 
    -  Before you start the install, you can download and store a copy of these files on your local network by using [Setup Downloader](../System Center Configuration Manager/Setup-Downloader-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md)
    -  If a local copy of these file is not available, the site server must have Internet access so it can download these files from Microsoft during the install

  - Before you can expand a stand-alone primary site that has a Service Connection Point site system role installed, you must uninstall the Service Connection Point. Only one instance of this role is permitted in a hierarchy, and it is only permitted at the top-tier site of the hierarchy. You will have the opportunity to reinstall the role during the installation of the central administration site. 
  - The site server and site database computers must meet all prerequisite configurations. Before starting setup, you can [manually run the Prerequisite Checker](../System Center Configuration Manager/Prerequisite-checker-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) to identify and fix problems.  


## <a name="bkmk_expand"></a> Expanding a stand-alone primary site
A stand-alone primary site must meet the following prerequisites before you can expand it into a hierarchy with a central administration site:

 
-   **You must install the new central administration site installation media (source files) that matches the version of the stand-alone primary site:**  
     To ensure a version match, install the new site using the source files found in the [CD.Latest folder](../System Center Configuration Manager/The-CD.Latest-folder-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) on the stand-alone primary site. 
     
     For more information about the correct source files to use to install different sites, see [Options for installing different types of sites](../System Center Configuration Manager/Prepare-to-install-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-sites.md#bkmk_options), in the [Prepare to install sites](../System Center Configuration Manager/Prepare-to-install-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-sites.md) topic. 
      
  
-   **The stand-alone primary site cannot be configured to migrate data from another [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] hierarchy:**  
  
     You must stop active migration to the stand-alone primary site, from other [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] hierarchies, and remove all configurations for migration. This includes migration jobs that have not completed, Data Gathering, and the configuration of the active source hierarchy.  
  
     This is necessary because migration operations are performed by the top-tier site of the hierarchy, and the configurations for migration do not transfer to the central administration site when you expand a stand-alone primary site.  
  
     After you expand the stand-alone primary site, if you reconfigure migration at the primary site, it will be the central administration site that performs the migration related operations. For more information about how to configure migration, see [Configuring source hierarchies and source sites for migration to System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Configuring-source-hierarchies-and-source-sites-for-migration-to-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
-   **The computer account of the computer that will host the new central administration site must be a member of the Administrators group on the stand-alone primary site:**  
  
     To successfully expand the stand-alone primary site, the computer account of the new central administration site must be a member of the stand-alone primary sites **Administrators** group. This is required only during site expansion and the account can be removed from the group on the primary site after site expansion completes.  
  
-   **The user account that runs setup to install the new central administration site must be granted role-based administration permissions at the stand-alone primary site:**  
  
     To install a central administration site as part of a site expansion scenario, the user account that runs setup to install the central administration site must be defined in role-based administration at the stand-alone primary site as either a **Full Administrator** or an **Infrastructure Administrator**.  
  
-   **You must uninstall the following site system roles from the stand-alone primary site before you can expand the site:**  
  
    -   Asset Intelligence synchronization point  
  
    -   Endpoint Protection point  
  
    -   Service connection point  
  
     These site system roles are supported only at the top-tier site of the hierarchy. Therefore, you must uninstall these site system roles before you expand the stand-alone primary site. After you expand the site, you can reinstall these site system roles at the central administration site.  
  
     All other site system roles can remain installed at the primary site.  
  
-   **The port for the SQL Server Service Broker must be open between the stand-alone primary site and the computer that will install the central administration site:**  
  
     To successfully replicate data between a central administration site and a primary site, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] requires that a port for use by the SQL Server Service Broker is open between the two sites. When you install a central administration and expand a stand-alone primary site, the prerequisite check does not establish that the port you specify for the SQL Server Service Broker is open on the primary site.  
  

## <a name="bkmk_secondary"></a> Secondary sites
The following are prerequisites for installing secondary sites:
-   The administrative user who configures the installation of the secondary site in the [!INCLUDE[cmconsole](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmconsole_md.md)] must have  role-based administration rights that are equivalent to the security role of **Infrastructure Administrator** or **Full Administrator**.  
  
-   The computer account of the parent primary site must be a **Local Administrator** on the secondary site server computer.  
  
-   When the secondary site uses a previously installed instance of SQL Server to host the secondary site database:  
  
    -   The **computer account** of the parent primary site must have **sysadmin** rights on the instance of SQL Server on the secondary site server computer.  
  
    -   The **Local System** account of the secondary site server computer must have **sysadmin** rights on the instance of SQL Server on the secondary site server computer.  
  
        > [!IMPORTANT]  
        >  After setup completes, both accounts must retain sysadmin rights to SQL Server. It is not supported to remove the sysadmin rights from these accounts.  
  
-   The secondary site server computer must meet all prerequisite configurations, which includes SQL Server and the default site system roles of the management point and distribution point.
