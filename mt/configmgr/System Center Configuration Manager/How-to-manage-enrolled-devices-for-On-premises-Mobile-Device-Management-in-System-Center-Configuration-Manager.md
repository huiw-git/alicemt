# How to manage enrolled devices for On-premises Mobile Device Management in System Center Configuration Manager
Once devices have been enrolled with        [!INCLUDE[onprem_first](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/onprem_first_md.md)], whether users have enrolled the devices themselves or you have bulk-enrolled them, you can begin managing them using the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console using the same functionality you use to manage client-based computers in your organization.  
  
 The following list provides common management tasks for mobile devices and where to look for more information in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] documentation.  
  
-   Configure settings on enrolled devices - See [Common tasks for managing compliance on devices not running the System Center Configuration Manager client](../System Center Configuration Manager/Common-tasks-for-managing-compliance-on-devices-not-running-the-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-client.md).  
  
-   Install applications on enrolled devices - See [Create and deploy an application with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Create-and-deploy-an-application-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
-   Set up certificates for accessing network resources from enrolled devices - See [Certificate profiles in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Certificate-profiles-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
-   Set up Wi-Fi access on enrolled devices - See [How to create Wi-Fi profiles in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-create-Wi-Fi-profiles-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  The current branch of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] only supports the following Wi-Fi security configurations for [!INCLUDE[onprem_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/onprem_next_md.md)]:  
    >   
    >  Security types: **WPA2 Enterprise** or **WPA2 Personal**  
    > Encryption types: **AES** or **TKIP**  
    > EAP types: **Smart Card or other certificate** or **PEAP**  
  
-   Report inventory on enrolled devices - [Inventory in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Inventory-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).
