# Data transfers between sites in System Center Configuration Manager
[!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] uses **file-based replication** and **database replication** to transfer different types of information between sites.  The following subjects in this topic can help you understand how [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] moves data between sites, and how you can manage the transfer of that data across your network:  
  
-   [File-based replication](#bkmk_fileroute)  
  
    -   [File replication routes](#bkmk_routes)  
  
-   [Database replication](#bkmk_dbrep)  
  
    -   [Database replication links](#bkmk_Dblinks)  
  
    -   [Distributed views](#bkmk_distviews)  
  
    -   [Schedule transfers of site data on database replication links](#BKMK_schedules)  
  
         [Summarization of database replication traffic](#BKMK_SummarizeDBReplication)  
  
    -   [Database Replication Thresholds](#BKMK_DBRepThresholds)  
  
-   [Site database replication controls](#BKMK_DBRepControls)  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_fileroute"></a> File-based replication  
 [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] uses file-based replication to transfer file-based data between sites in your hierarchy. This data includes content such as applications and packages that you want to deploy to distribution points in child sites, and unprocessed discovery data records that are transferred to parent sites where they are processed.  
  
 File-based communication between sites uses the **Server Message Block** (SMB) protocol by using **TCP/IP port 445**. You can specify configurations that include bandwidth throttling and pulse mode to control the amount of data transferred across the network, and schedules to control when to send data across the network.  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_routes"></a> File replication routes  
 The following information can help you configure and use file replication routes:  
  
 **File replication route** - Each file replication route identifies a destination site to which file-based data can transfer. Each site supports a single file replication route to a specific destination site.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] supports the following configurations for file replication routes:  
  
-   **File Replication Account**: This account is used to connect to the destination site and to write data to that site’s **SMS_SITE** share. Data written to this share is processed by the receiving site. By default, when a site is added to the hierarchy, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] assigns the computer account of the new sites site server as that sites **File Replication Account**. This account is then added to the destination site’s **SMS_SiteToSiteConnection_<Sitecode\>** group which is a local group on the computer that grants access to the **SMS_SITE** share. You can change this account to be a Windows user account. If you change the account, ensure you add the new account to the destination site’s **SMS_SiteToSiteConnection_<Sitecode\>** group.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Secondary sites always use the computer account of the secondary site server as the **File Replication Account**.  
  
-   **Schedule**: You can configure the schedule for each file replication route to restrict the type of data and time when data can transfer to the destination site.  
  
-   **Rate Limits**: You can configure rate limits for each file replication route to control the network bandwidth that is used when the site transfers data to the destination site:  
  
    -   Use **Pulse mode** to specify the size of the data blocks that are sent to the destination site. You can also specify a time delay between sending each data block. Use this option when you must send data across a very low bandwidth network connection to the destination site. For example, you might have constraints to send 1 KB of data every five seconds, but not 1 KB every three seconds, regardless of the speed of the link or its usage at a given time.  
  
    -   Use **Limited to maximum transfer rates by hour** to have a site send data to a destination site by using only the percentage of time that you specify. When you use this option, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] does not identify the network’s available bandwidth, but instead divides the time it can send data into slices of time. Then data is sent in a short block of time, which is followed by blocks of time when data is not sent. For example, if the maximum rate is set to **50%**, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] transmits data for an amount of time followed by an equal period of time when no data is sent. The actual size amount of data, or size of the data block, is not managed. Instead, only the amount of time during which data is sent is managed.  
  
        > [!CAUTION]  
        >  By default, a site can use up to three **concurrent sendings** to transfer data to a destination site. When you enable rate limits for a file replication route, the **concurrent sendings** for sending data to that site are limited to one. This applies even when the **Limit available bandwidth (%)** is set to **100%**. For example, if you use the default settings for the sender, this reduces the transfer rate to the destination site to be one third of the default capacity.  
  
-   You can configure a file replication route between two secondary sites to route file-based content between those sites.  
  
 To manage a file replication route, in the **Administration** workspace, expand the **Hierarchy Configuration** node, and select **File Replication**.  
  
 **Sender** - Each site has one sender. The sender manages the network connection from one site to a destination site, and can establish connections to multiple sites at the same time. To connect to a site, the sender uses the file replication route to the site to identify the account to use to establish the network connection. The sender also uses this account to write data to the destination site’s **SMS_SITE** share.  
  
 By default, the sender writes data to a destination site by using multiple **concurrent sendings**, typically referred to as a thread. Each concurrent sending, or thread, can transfer a different file-based object to the destination site. By default, when the sender begins to send an object, the sender continues to write blocks of data for that object until the entire object is sent. After all the data for the object has been sent, a new object can begin to send on that thread.  
  
 You can configure the following settings for a sender:  
  
-   **Maximum concurrent sendings**: By default, each site is configured to use five **concurrent sendings**, with three available for use when it sends data to any one destination site. When you increase this number you can increase the throughput of data between sites by enabling [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to transfer more files at the same time. Increasing this number also increases the demand for network bandwidth between sites.  
  
-   **Retry settings**: By default, each site is configured to retry a problem connection two times with a one minute delay between connection attempts. You can modify the number of connection attempts the site makes, and how long to wait between those attempts.  
  
 To manage the sender for a site, expand the **Site Configuration** node in the **Administration** workspace, select the **Sites** node, and then click **Properties** for the site that you want to manage. Click the **Sender** tab to change the sender configuration.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_dbrep"></a> Database replication  
 [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] database replication uses SQL Server to transfer data and merge changes that are made in a site database with the information stored in the database at other sites in the hierarchy.  
  
-   This enables all sites to share the same information  
  
-   When you install a site in a hierarchy, database replication automatically configures between the new site and its designated parent site  
  
-   When the site installation finishes, database replication automatically starts  
  
 When you add a new site to a hierarchy, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] creates a generic database at that new site. Next, the parent site creates a snapshot of the relevant data in its database and transfers that snapshot to the new site by file-based replication. The new site then uses a SQL Server bulk copy program (BCP) to load the information into its local copy of the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] database. After the snapshot loads, each site conducts database replication with the other site.  
  
 To replicate data between sites, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] uses its own database replication service. The database replication service uses SQL Server change tracking to monitor the local site database for changes, and then replicates those changes to other sites by using a **SQL Server Service Broker**. By default, this process uses the **TCP/IP port 4022**.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] groups data that replicates by database replication into different replication groups.  
  
-   Each replication group has a separate, fixed replication schedule that determines how frequently changes to the data in the group is replicated to other sites.  
  
     For example, a configuration change to a role-based administration configuration replicates quickly to other sites to ensure that these changes are enforced as soon as possible. Meanwhile a lower priority configuration change, such as a request to install a new secondary site, replicates with less urgency and takes several minutes for the new site request to reach the destination primary site  
  
-   You can modify the following for database replication:  
  
    -   **Database replication links** let you control when specific traffic traverses the network.  
  
    -   **Distributed views** are a configuration for replication links that  enable requests that are made at a central administration site for selected site data, to access that site data directly from the database at a child primary site.  
  
    -   **Schedules** let you configure when a replication link is used, and specify when different types of site data replicates.  
  
    -   **Summarization** of data about network traffic that transverse replication links occurs every 15 minutes, by default, and is used in reports for database replication.  
  
    -   **Database replication thresholds** define when links are reported as degraded or failed. You can also configure when [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] raises alerts about replication links that have a status of degraded or failed.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] classifies the data that it replicates by database replication as either global data or site data. When database replication occurs, changes to global data and site data are transferred across the database replication link. Global data can replicate to both a parent or child site, and site replicates only to a parent site. A third data type that is named local data, does not replicate to other sites. Local data includes information that is not required by other sites:  
  
-   **Global Data**: Global data refers to administrator-created objects that replicate to all sites throughout the hierarchy, although secondary sites receive only a subset of global data, as global proxy data. Examples of global data include software deployments, software updates, collection definitions, and role-based administration security scopes. Administrators can create global data at central administration sites and primary sites.  
  
-   **Site Data**: Site data refers to operational information that [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] primary sites and the clients that report to primary sites create. Site data replicates to the central administration site but not to other primary sites. Examples of site data include hardware inventory data, status messages, alerts, and the results from query-based collections. Site data is only viewable at the central administration site and the primary site where the data originates. Site data can be modified only at the primary site where it was created.  
  
     All site data replicates to the central administration site; therefore the central administration site can perform administration and reporting for the whole hierarchy.  
  
 The following sections detail configurations you can make to manage database replication  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_Dblinks"></a> Database replication links  
 When you install a new site in a hierarchy, [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] automatically creates a database replication link between the two sites. A single link is created to connect the new site to the parent site.  
  
 Each database replication link supports configurations to help control the transfer of data across the replication link. Each replication link supports separate configurations. The controls for database replication links include the following:  
  
-   Use distributed views to stop the replication of selected site data from a primary site to the central administration site, and enable the central administration site to directly access this data from the database of the primary site.  
  
-   Schedule when selected site data transfers from a child primary site to the central administration site.  
  
-   Define the settings that determine when a database replication link is in a degraded status or has failed.  
  
-   Configure when to raise alerts for a failed replication link.  
  
-   Specify how frequently [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] summarizes data about the replication traffic that uses the replication link. This data is used in reports.  
  
 To configure a database replication link, you edit the properties for the link in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console from the **Database Replication** node. This node appears in both the **Monitoring** workspace and under the **Hierarchy Configuration** node in the **Administration** workspace. You can edit a replication link from either the parent site or the child site of the replication link.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  You can edit database replication links from the **Database Replication** node in either workspace. However, when you use the **Database Replication** node in the **Monitoring** workspace you can also view the status of database replication for replication links, and access the Replication Link Analyzer tool to help you investigate problems with database replication.  
  
 For information about how to configure replication links, see [Site database replication controls](#BKMK_DBRepControls). For more information about how to monitor replication, see the [How to monitor database replication links and replication status](../System Center Configuration Manager/Monitor-hierarchy-and-replication-infrastructure-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_MonitorRepLinksAndStatuss) section in the [Monitor hierarchy and replication infrastructure in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Monitor-hierarchy-and-replication-infrastructure-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) topic.  
  
 Use the information in the following sections to plan for database replication links.  
  
###  <a name="bkmk_distviews"></a> Distributed views  
 Distributed views enable requests that are made at a central administration site for selected site data, to access that site data directly from the database at a child primary site. This direct access replaces the need to replicate this site data from the primary site to the central administration site. Because each replication link is independent from other replication links, you can enable distributed views on only the replication links you choose. Distributed views are not supported between a primary site and a secondary site.  
  
 Distributed views can provide the following benefits:  
  
-   Reduce the CPU load to process database changes at the central administration site and primary sites.  
  
-   Reduce the amount of data that transfers across the network to the central administration site.  
  
-   Improve the performance of the SQL Server that hosts the central administration sites database.  
  
-   Reduce the disk space used by the database at the central administration site.  
  
 Consider using distributed views when a primary site is located in close proximity on the network to the central administration site, and the two sites are always on, and always connected. This is because distributed views replace the replication of the selected data between the sites with direct connections between the SQL Servers at each site. This direct connection is made each time a request for this data is made at the central administration site. Typically, requests for data you might enable for distributed views is made when you run reports or queries, view information in Resource Explorer, and by collection evaluation for collections that include rules that are based on the site data.  
  
 By default, distributed views are disabled for each replication link. When you enable distributed views for a replication link, you select site data that will not replicate to the central administration site across that link, and enable the central administration site to access this data directly from the database of the child primary site that shares the link. You can configure the following types of site data for distributed views:  
  
-   Hardware inventory data from clients  
  
-   Software inventory and metering data from clients  
  
-   Status messages from clients, the primary site, and all secondary sites  
  
 Operationally, distributed views are invisible to an administrative user who views data in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console or in reports. When a request is made for data that is enabled for distributed views, the SQL Server that hosts the database for the central administration site directly accesses the SQL Server of the child primary site to retrieve the information. For example, you use a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console at the central administration site to request information about hardware inventory from two sites, and only one site has hardware inventory enabled for a distributed view. The inventory information for clients from the site that is not configured for distributed views is retrieved from the database at the central administration site. The inventory information for clients from the site that is configured for distributed views is accessed from the database at child primary site. This information appears in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console or report without distinction as to the source.  
  
 As long as a replication link has a type of data enabled for distributed views, the child primary site does not replicate that data to the central administration site. As soon as you turn off distributed views for a type of data, the child primary site resumes the replication of that data to the central administration site as part of normal data replication. However, before this data is available at the central administration site, the replication groups that contain this data must reinitialize between the primary site and the central administration site. Similarly, after you uninstall a primary site that has distributed views enabled, the central administration site must complete reinitialization of its data before you can access data that was enabled for distributed views on the central administration site.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When you use distributed views on any replication link in the hierarchy, you must disable distributed views for all replication links before you uninstall any primary site. For more information, see [Uninstall a primary site that is configured with distributed views](../System Center Configuration Manager/Uninstall-sites-and-hierarchies-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_UninstallPrimaryDistViews).  
  
 **Prerequisites and limitations for distributed views:**  
  
-   Distributed views are supported only on replication links between a central administration site and a primary site.  
  
-   The central administration site can have only one instance of the SMS Provider installed, and that instance must be installed on the site database server. This is required to support the Kerberos authentication required to enable the SQL Server at the central administration site to access the SQL Server at the child primary site. There are no limitations on the SMS Provider at the child primary site.  
  
-   The central administration site can have only one SQL Server Reporting Services point installed, and it must be located on site database server. This is required to support the Kerberos authentication required to enable the SQL Server at the central administration site to access the SQL Server at the child primary site.  
  
-   The site database cannot be hosted on a SQL Server cluster.  
  
-   The site database cannot be hosted on a SQL Server AlwaysOn availability group.  
  
-   The computer account of the database server from the central administration site requires **Read** permissions to the site database of the primary site.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Distributed views and schedules for when data can replicate are mutually exclusive configurations for a database replication link.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_schedules"></a> Schedule transfers of site data on database replication links  
 To help you control the network bandwidth that is used to replicate site data from a child primary site to its central administration site, you can schedule when a replication link is used, and specify when different types of site data replicates. You can control when the primary site replicates status messages, inventory, and metering data. Database replication links from secondary sites do not support schedules for site data. The transfer of global data cannot be scheduled.  
  
 When you configure a database replication link schedule, you can restrict the transfer of selected site data from the primary site to the central administration site, and you can configure different times to replicate different types of site data.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Distributed views and schedules for when data can replicate are mutually exclusive configurations for a database replication link.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_SummarizeDBReplication"></a> Summarization of database replication traffic  
 Each site periodically summarizes data about the network traffic that traverses database replication links that include the site. This summarized data is used in reports for database replication. Both sites on a replication link summarize the network traffic that traverses the replication link. The summarization of data is performed by the SQL Server that hosts the site database. After summarization of the data, this information replicates to other sites as global data.  
  
 By default, summarization occurs every 15 minutes. You can modify the frequency of summarization for network traffic by editing the **Summarization interval** in the properties of the database replication link. The frequency of summarization affects the information you view in reports about database replication. You can modify this interval from 5 minutes to 60 minutes. When you increase the frequency of summarization, you increase the processing load on the SQL Server at each site on the replication link.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_DBRepThresholds"></a> Database Replication Thresholds  
 Database replication thresholds define when the status of a database replication link is reported as either degraded or failed. By default, a link is set to degraded when any one replication group fails to complete replication for a period of 12 consecutive attempts, and set to failed when any replication group fails to replicate in 24 consecutive attempts.  
  
 You can specify custom values to fine-tune when [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] reports a replication link as degraded or failed. Adjusting when [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] reports each status for your database replication links can help you accurately monitor the health of database replication across your database replication links.  
  
 Because it is possible for one or a few replication groups fail to replicate while other replication groups continue to replicate successfully, plan to review the replication status of a replication link when it first reports a status of degraded. If there are recurring delays for specific replication groups and their delay does not present a problem, or where the network link between sites has low available bandwidth, consider modifying the retry values for the degraded or failed status of the link. When you increase the number of retries before the link is set to degrade or failed, you can eliminate false warnings for known issues, allowing you to more accurately track the status of the link.  
  
 You should also consider the replication synchronization interval for each replication groups to understand how frequently replication of that group occurs. You can view the **Synchronization Interval** for replication groups on the **Replication Detail** tab of a replication link in the **Database Replication** node in the **Monitoring** workspace.  
  
 For more information about how to monitor database replication including how to view the replication status, see the [How to monitor database replication links and replication status](../System Center Configuration Manager/Monitor-hierarchy-and-replication-infrastructure-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_MonitorRepLinksAndStatuss) section in the [How to monitor database replication links and replication status](../System Center Configuration Manager/Monitor-hierarchy-and-replication-infrastructure-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_MonitorRepLinksAndStatuss) topic.  
  
 For information on configuring database replication thresholds, see [Site database replication controls](#BKMK_DBRepControls).  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_DBRepControls"></a> Site database replication controls  
 Each site database supports configurations that can help you control the network bandwidth used for database replication. These configurations apply only to the site database where you configure the settings, and are always used when the site replicates any data by database replication to any other site.  
  
 Replication controls for each site database include the following:  
  
-   Change the port that [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] uses for the SQL Server Service Broker.  
  
-   Configure the period of time to wait before replication failures trigger the site to reinitializes its copy of the site database.  
  
-   Configure a site database to compress the data that it replicates by database replication. The data is compressed only for transfer between sites, and not for storage in the site database at either site.  
  
 To configure the replication controls for a site database, you edit the properties of the site database in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console from the **Database Replication** node. This node appears under the **Hierarchy Configuration** node in the **Administration** workspace, and also appears in the **Monitoring workspace**. To edit the properties of the site database, select the replication link between the sites, and then open either the **Parent Database Properties** or **Child Database Properties**.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  You can configure database replication controls from the **Database Replication** node in either workspace. However, when you use the **Database Replication** node in the **Monitoring** workspace you can also view the status of database replication for a replication link, and access the Replication Link Analyzer tool to help you investigate problems with replication.
