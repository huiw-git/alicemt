# How to monitor email profiles in System Center Configuration Manager
After you have deployed [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] email profiles to users in your hierarchy, you can use the following procedures to monitor the compliance status of the Wi-Fi profile:  
  
-   [To Configure Client Status](#BKMK_1)  
  
-   [To Configure Alerts for Client Status](#BKMK_2)  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_1"></a> How to View Compliance Results in the Configuration Manager Console  
 Use this procedure to view details about the compliance of deployed email profiles in the [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] console.  
  
#### To view compliance results in the Configuration Manager console  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] console, click **Monitoring**.  
  
2.  In the **Monitoring** workspace, click **Deployments**.  
  
3.  In the **Deployments** list, select the email profile deployment for which you want to review compliance information.  
  
4.  You can review summary information about the compliance of the email profile deployment on the main page. To view more detailed information, select the email profile deployment, and then, on the **Home** tab, in the **Deployment** group, click **View Status** to open the **Deployment Status** page.  
  
     The **Deployment Status** page contains the following tabs:  
  
    -   **Compliant:** Displays the compliance of the email profile that is based on the number of affected assets. You can double-click a rule to create a temporary node under the **Users** node in the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, which contains all users that are compliant with this profile. The **Asset Details** pane displays the users that are compliant with the email profile. Double-click a user in the list to display additional information.  
  
        > [!IMPORTANT]  
        >  An email profile is not evaluated if it is not applicable on a client device; however, it is returned as compliant.  
  
    -   **Error:** Displays a list of all errors for the selected email profile deployment that is based on the number of affected assets. You can double-click a rule to create a temporary node under the **Users** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, which contains all users that generated errors with this profile. When you select a user, the **Asset Details** pane displays the users that are affected by the selected issue. Double-click a user in the list to display additional information about the issue.  
  
    -   **Non-Compliant:** Displays a list of all noncompliant rules within the email profile that is based on the number of affected assets. You can double-click a rule to create a temporary node under the **Users** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, which contains all users that are not compliant with this profile. When you select a user, the **Asset Details** pane displays the users that are affected by the selected issue. Double-click a user in the list to display further information about the issue.  
  
    -   **Unknown:** Displays a list of all users that did not report compliance for the selected email profile deployment together with the current client status of the devices.  
  
5.  On the **Deployment Status** page, you can review detailed information about the compliance of the deployed email profile. A temporary node is created under the **Deployments** node that helps you find this information again quickly.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_2"></a> How to View Compliance Results by Using Reports  
 Compliance settings, which include email profiles in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)], also includes a number of built-in reports that let you monitor information about email profiles. These reports have the report category of **Compliance and Settings Management**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must use a wildcard (%) character when you use the parameters **Device filter** and **User filter** in the compliance settings reports.
