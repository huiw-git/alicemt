##  <a name="compat"></a> Compatibility with Configuration Manager versions  
 Each section of this article lists hybrid features under 3 different categories. Use the following guidance to determine compatibility of the features in each category  with different versions of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]:  
  
|Feature categories|
|-|  
|**New in [!INCLUDE[mit_first](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_first_md.md)]** - In general, all the features listed under this category should work with all [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] releases including [!INCLUDE[sccm2012r2_1](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/sccm2012r2_1_md.md)] releases, since these features only require the  [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] service and do not require additional functionality in  [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].<br /><br /> **New in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] Technical Preview** - All the features listed under this category only work with the specified Technical Preview release. To try out these features, you must install the Technical Preview version specified in the feature description. For more information, see [Technical Preview for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Technical-Preview-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).<br /><br /> **New in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] (current branch)** - All the features listed under this category only work with the specified version of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] (current branch), such as version 1511 or 1602. If you're using an older version of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] for your hybrid deployment, you must upgrade to the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] (current branch)  version specified in the feature description. For more information, see [Upgrade to System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Upgrade-to-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).|  

## New hybrid features in July 2016

### New in Microsoft Intune

The following features introduced in July 2016 work in hybrid deployments exactly as they do in the standalone Intune service. No changes or administration in Configuration Manager are required to use these features.

- **Xamarin SDK for Intune apps is available**

  The Intune App SDK Xamarin component allows you to enable the Intune mobile app management features in your mobile iOS and Android apps built with Xamarin. You can find the component in the [Xamarin store](https://components.xamarin.com/view/Microsoft.Intune.MAM) or on the [Microsoft Intune Github page](https://github.com/msintuneappsdk).

- **Improved end-user experience when enrolling Windows devices**

  When you are using conditional access, the enrollment steps for Windows 8.1, Windows 10 Desktop, and Windows 10 Mobile have been clarified in the Company Portal website. Users will now see separate **Device enrollment** and **Workplace Join** steps, making it easier for them to see the status of their device and to complete the process if they experience a Workplace Join (WPJ) failure. The separate steps are also expected to simplify the troubleshooting process for IT administrators. Previously, when end users tried to enroll and all enrollment steps succeeded except for WPJ, the enrolled device would not appear on the list of devices for users to identify, causing confusion for users.
 
 - **Full wipe now available for Windows 10 devices**
 
    Windows 10 PCs and laptops enrolled as mobile devices can be wiped to reset the device to its factory settings. For more information, see [How to protect your devices with remote wipe](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt634519.aspx).

- **Changes to Device Enrollment Managers accounts in the iOS Company Portal app**

  To improve performance and scale, Intune no longer displays all Device Enrollment Managers (DEM) devices in the My Devices pane of the iOS Company Portal app. Only the local device running the app is displayed, and only if it is enrolled via the Company Portal app.

  The DEM user may perform actions on the local device, but remote management of other enrolled devices can only be performed from the Intune admin console. Additionally, Intune is deprecating use of DEM accounts with either the Apple Device Enrollment Program or the Apple Configurator tool. Both these enrollment methods already support user-less enrollment for shared iOS devices.

  Only use DEM accounts when user-less enrollment for shared devices is unavailable. For more information, see [Enroll corporate-owned devices with the Device Enrollment Manager in Microsoft Intune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/deploy-use/enroll-corporate-owned-devices-with-the-device-enrollment-manager-in-microsoft-intune).

- **Changes to the Android Company Portal app**

  If Android end users see an error message that says their device is missing a required certificate, they can tap a "How to resolve this" button to get steps for installing the missing certificate. If users complete the steps, but see an additional "missing certificate" error message, they are asked to contact their IT administrator and provide this link, which contains steps that IT administrators can use to fix the certificate issue.

- **Restrict side-loaded app installations to enrolled Android devices**

  Android devices can no longer install applications through the Company Portal website unless the devices have been enrolled in Intune by using the Intune Company Portal app for Android.


### New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview

No new hybrid features have been introduced in July 2016 for Configuration Manager Technical Preview.

### New in Configuration Manager (current branch)

The following features that were previously available in Configuration Manager Technical Preview releases are now available in hybrid deployments with Intune and Configuration Manager (current branch) version 1606. These features require you to use the Configuration Manager console to configure and manage them.

* Find, manage, and distribute Windows Store for Business apps for Windows 10 devices from the Configuration Manager console ([1604](#TP1604))
* 	SmartLock setting for Android devices ([1604](#TP1604))
*	App-triggered VPN for Windows 10 devices ([1605](#TP1605))
*	New experience for remote device actions ([1605](#TP1605))
*	Windows Store for Business apps ([1605](#TP1605))
*	General improvements for volume-purchased apps ([1605](#TP1605))
*	Windows Information Protection (WIP) ([1605](#TP1605))
*	Pre-declare corporate-owned devices with IMEI or iOS serial number ([1605](#TP1605))
*	Automatically categorize devices into collections ([1606](#TP1606))

  Policy  |Effect on users  
  ---------|---------
  Require that devices disallow installation of apps from unknown sources (Android 4.0+)     |  End users with Android 4.0 or later devices will see the message, "Installation from Unknown sources must be disabled." Users will need to go to **Settings > Security** on their devices, and turn off **Unknown sources**. A link in the compliance message lets users get more information about the message and why they are being required to turn off the setting.
  Require that devices disallow installation of apps from unknown sources (Android 4.0+)  |    End users with Android 4.0 or later devices will see the message, "Scan device for security threats." Users will need to go to **Settings > Google > Security** on their devices, and turn on **Scan device for security threats**. A link in the compliance message lets users get more information about the message and why they are being required to turn on the setting.     
  Require that USB debugging is disabled (Android 4.2+)  | End users with Android 4.2 or later devices will see the message, "USB debugging must be disabled." Users will need to go to **Settings > Developer options** on their devices, and turn off **USB debugging**. A link in the compliance message lets users get more information about the message and why they are being required to turn off the setting.
  Minimum Android security patch level (Android 6.0+)  | End users with Android 6.0 or later devices will see the message, "This device does not meet the minimum Android security patch level." Users will need to install the required security patch. A link in the compliance message lets users get information about how to install the required security patch and to see which security patch they currently have installed.

- **Updates to the iOS Company Portal app**

  * When end users are installing line-of-business apps, they will now see an improved app installation experience. If the app installation is taking a long time, users can manually sync their device to force the sync process to resume. To review the end-user instructions, see Sync your iOS device manually.
  * The Microsoft Intune Company Portal app for iOS has been updated to support iOS version 8.0 and later. This update means that end users can install the Company Portal app and enroll new devices in Intune only if the device is running iOS version 8.0 or later. Users who have already enrolled devices that are running on an unsupported version of iOS can continue to use the Company Portal app that is on their device.

### <a name="TP1606"></a> New in Configuration Manager Technical Preview
The following new features introduced in June 2016 are available in hybrid deployments with Intune and Configuration Manager Technical Preview 1606. These features require you to use the Configuration Manager console to configure and manage them.

All existing [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] features currently available for managing iOS devices will continue to work seamlessly as users upgrade their devices to iOS 9.3.  
  
- **Windows app packages available directly from the Company Portal website**
  
  Users of Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows RT PCs can now install Windows app packages (with the .appx extension) directly from the Company Portal website. Previously, you had to deploy, or users had to install the Company Portal app on their devices to install apps.  
  
- **Users can remotely lock their device from the Company Portal website**
  
  A new Remote Lock option has been added to the Company Portal website to enable users to remotely lock their device from the Portal if their device is lost or stolen.  
  
- **Take advantage of iOS "Open-in" management for devices that are enrolled in a third-party MDM solution**
  
  You can use your third-party mobile device management (MDM) vendor to take advantage of iOS "Open-In" management. You can set the restrictions in the configuration profile settings and deploy the app using your MDM software. When the user installs the managed app, the restrictions are applied. Read the details: [Microsoft Intune mobile app management policies and iOS Open In](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt627821.aspx) in the [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] library.  
  
- **Microsoft apps that support MAM**
  
  The list of Microsoft apps you can use with [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] mobile application management policies has been updated to include the latest apps (for devices that are enrolled with [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] only).  
  
- **Deploy Adobe Reader for Microsoft Intune to Intune-managed iOS devices in your enterprise** 
  
  The Adobe Reader app for iOS can now be managed on enrolled devices with the [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] mobile application management policy.  
  
- The Rights Management sharing app is supported for Android
  
  IT administrators can deploy mobile application management policies so end users can view images, AV, and PDF files more securely, whether or not IT uses [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)] to manage the devices.  
  
- **Improvements to the Android and iOS Company Portal app**
  
  -   When your users launch an app that is managed by mobile application management (MAM), they will see a message notifying them that the app is managed by their company. Users can now tap a “Learn More” link to get more information here about what “managed apps” means. They can also tap “Don’t Show Again” so that the message no longer appears when they launch the app.  
  
  -   New screens have been added to guide users through the enrollment process and provide more information about why users should enroll and what IT administrators can and can’t see on their enrolled devices.  
  
  -   Enrollment error messages are now displayed in the Company Portal app.
