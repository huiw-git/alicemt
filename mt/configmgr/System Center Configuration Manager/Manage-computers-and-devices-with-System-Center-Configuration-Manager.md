# Manage computers and devices with System Center Configuration Manager
Within a [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] hierarchy of sites, you can manage PCs, servers, and mobile devices in a number of ways depending on the types of platforms you have in your organization and the functionality you require to manage those platforms. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] can manage  
  
-   Windows PCs and mobile devices  
  
-   Windows Embedded devices  
  
-   Mac OS X computers  
  
-   UNIX and Linux servers  
  
-   Android mobile devices  
  
-   iOS mobile devices  
  
## In this section  
 With the details provided in the following sections, learn about how to set up [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to manage computers and devices:  
  
-   [Manage computer clients with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Manage-computer-clients-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md)  
  
     Learn about how to set up [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to manage computers  with the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client. This solution provides the most scalable and  robust functionality for managing computers and servers in an organization, however with the tradeoff of having to maintain  the client software on each computer to be managed.  
  
-   [Manage mobile devices with on-premises infrastructure in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Manage-mobile-devices-with-on-premises-infrastructure-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md)  
  
     Learn about new functionality in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] that provides management using the  capabilities built into modern device platforms. In contrast with using [!INCLUDE[mit_first](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_first_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)], this solution uses the on-premises infrastructure of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to communicate and manage those platforms.  
  
-   [Hybrid mobile device management (MDM) with System Center Configuration Manager and Microsoft Intune](../System Center Configuration Manager/Hybrid-mobile-device-management--MDM--with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-and-Microsoft-Intune.md)  
  
     Learn about how to use the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console to manage mobile devices through [!INCLUDE[mit_first](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_first_md.md)]. With this solution, the management infrastructure for communicating and managing mobile devices is provided by [!INCLUDE[mit_next](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/mit_next_md.md)], which is connected to [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] allowing you to perform management tasks from the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console.  
  
-   [Manage mobile devices with System Center Configuration Manager and Exchange](../System Center Configuration Manager/Manage-mobile-devices-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-and-Exchange.md)  
  
     Learn about how to use the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console to manage devices through Microsoft Exchange Active Sync. This solution relies Exchange to manage the device platforms instead of the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] infrastructure.
