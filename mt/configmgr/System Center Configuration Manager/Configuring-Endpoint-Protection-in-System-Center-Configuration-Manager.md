# Configuring Endpoint Protection in System Center Configuration Manager
Before you can use [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] to manage security and malware on Configuration Manager client computers, you must perform the configuration steps detailed in this topic.  
  
## How to Configure Endpoint Protection in Configuration Manager  
 Endpoint Protection in Configuration Manager has external dependencies and dependencies in the product.  
  
### Steps to Configure [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]  
 Use the following table for the steps, details, and more information about how to configure Endpoint Protection.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you manage endpoint protection for Windows 10 computers, then you must configure Configuration Manager to update and distribute malware definitions for Windows Defender. Windows Defender is included in Windows 10 but SCEPInstall must still be installed and custom client settings for Endpoint Protection (**Step 5** below) are still required.  
  
|Steps|Details|  
|-----------|-------------|  
|**Step 1:** Create an [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] point site system role.|The [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] point site system role must be installed before you can use [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)]. It must be installed on one site system server only, and it must be installed at the top of the hierarchy on a central administration site or a stand-alone primary site. See [Step 1: Create an Endpoint Protection Point Site System Role](../System Center Configuration Manager/Configuring-Endpoint-Protection-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_Step1) in this topic.|  
|**Step 2:** Configure alerts for [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)].|Alerts inform the administrator when specific events have occurred, such as a malware infection. Alerts are displayed in the **Alerts** node of the **Monitoring** workspace, or optionally can be emailed to specified users. See [Step 2: Configure Alerts for Endpoint Protection](../System Center Configuration Manager/Configuring-Endpoint-Protection-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_EPalerts).|  
|**Step 3:** Configure definition update sources for [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] clients.|[!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] can be configured to use various sources to download definition updates. See [Step 3: Configure Definition Updates for Endpoint Protection](../System Center Configuration Manager/Configuring-Endpoint-Protection-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_EPdefs).|  
|**Step 4:** Configure the default antimalware policy and create any custom antimalware policies.|The default antimalware policy is applied when the [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] client is installed. Any custom policies you have deployed are applied by default, within 60 minutes of deploying the client. Ensure that you have configured antimalware policies before you deploy the [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] client.See [How to create and deploy antimalware policies for Endpoint Protection in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-create-and-deploy-antimalware-policies-for-Endpoint-Protection-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).|  
|**Step 5:** Configure custom client settings for Endpoint Protection.|Use custom client settings to configure [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] settings for collections of computers in your hierarchy.<br /><br /> Note: Do not configure the default [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] client settings unless you are sure that you want these settings applied to all computers in your hierarchy. See [Step 5: Configure Custom Client Settings for Endpoint Protection](../System Center Configuration Manager/Configuring-Endpoint-Protection-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md#BKMK_EPclient) in this topic.|  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_Step1"></a> Step 1: Create an Endpoint Protection  Point Site System Role  
 Use one of the following procedures depending on whether you want to install a new site system server for [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] or use an existing site system server.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  When you install an [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] point, an [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] client is installed on the server hosting the [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] point. Services and scans are disabled on this client to enable it to co-exist with any existing antimalware solution that is installed on the server. If you later enable this server for management by [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] and select the option to remove any third-party antimalware solution, the third-party product will not be removed. You must uninstall this product manually.

6.  On the **Endpoint Protection** page, select the **I accept the Endpoint Protection license terms** check box, and then click **Next**.  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  You cannot use [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] unless you accept the license terms.  
  
7.  On the **Microsoft Active Protection Service** page, select the level of information that you want to send to Microsoft to help develop new definitions, and then click **Next**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This option configures the Microsoft Active Protection Service settings that are used by default. You can configure custom settings for each antimalware policy you configure. For more information, see [How to create and deploy antimalware policies for Endpoint Protection in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-create-and-deploy-antimalware-policies-for-Endpoint-Protection-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
8.  Complete the wizard.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_EPalerts"></a> Step 2: Configure Alerts for Endpoint Protection  
 You can configure [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] alerts in [!INCLUDE[cm5long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm5long_md.md)] to notify administrative users when specific security events occur in your hierarchy. Notifications display in the [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] dashboard in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, in reports, and you can configure them to be emailed to specified recipients.  
  
 Use the following steps and the supplemental procedures in this topic to configure alerts for [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must have the **Enforce Security** permission for collections to configure [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] alerts.  
  
#### Steps to Configure Alerts for [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]

8.  Depending on the alert that you select, specify the following additional information:  
  
    -   **Malware detection** - This alert is generated if malware is detected on any computer in the collection that you monitor. The **Malware detection threshold** specifies the malware detection levels at which this alert is generated:  
  
        -   **High – All detections** - The alert is generated when there are one or more computers in the specified collection on which any malware is detected, regardless of what action the [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] client takes.  
  
        -   **Medium – Detected, pending action** - The alert is generated when there is one or more computers in the specified collection on which malware is detected, and you must manually remove the malware.  
  
        -   **Low – Detected, still active** - The alert is generated when there are one or more computers in the specified collection on which malware is detected and is still active.  
  
    -   **Malware outbreak** - This alert is generated if specified malware is detected on a specified percentage of computers in the collection that you monitor.  
  
        -   **Percentage of computers with malware detected** – The alert is generated when the percentage of computers with malware that is detected in the collection exceeds the percentage that you specify. Specify a percentage from **1** through **99**.  
  
            > [!NOTE]  
            >  The percentage value is based on the number of computers in the collection, but excludes computers that do not have a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client installed. It includes computers that do not yet have the [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] client installed.  
  
    -   **Repeated malware detection** - This alert is generated if specific malware is detected more than a specified number of times over a specified number of hours on the computers in the collection that you monitor. Specify the following information to configure this alert:  
  
        -   **Number of times malware has been detected:** - The alert is generated when the same malware is detected on computers in the collection more than the specified number of times. Specify a number from **2** through **32**.  
  
        -   **Interval for detection (hours):** Specify the detection interval (in hours) in which the number of malware detections must occur. Specify a number from **1** through **168**.  
  
    -   **Multiple malware detection** - This alert is generated if more than a specified number of malware types are detected over a specified number of hours on computers in the collection that you monitor. Specify the following information to configure this alert:  
  
        -   **Number of malware types detected:** The alert is generated when the specified number of different malware types are detected on computers in the collection. Specify a number from **2** through **32**.

9. Click **OK** to close the *<Collection Name\>***Properties** dialog box.  
  
###  <a name="BKMK_EPdefs"></a> Step 3: Configure Definition Updates for Endpoint Protection  
 With [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[cm5long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm5long_md.md)], you can use any of several available methods to keep antimalware definitions up to date on client computers in your hierarchy. The information in this topic can help you to select and configure these methods.  
  
 To update antimalware definitions, you can use one or more of the following methods:  
  
-   Updates distributed from [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] – This method uses [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] software updates to deliver definition and engine updates to computers in your hierarchy.  
  
-   Updates distributed from Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) – This method uses your WSUS infrastructure to deliver definition and engine updates to computers.  
  
-   Updates distributed from Microsoft Update – This method allows computers to connect directly to Microsoft Update in order to download definition and engine updates. This method can be useful for computers that are not often connected to the business network.  
  
-   Updates distributed from Microsoft Malware Protection Center – This method will download definition updates from the Microsoft Malware Protection Center.  
  
-   Updates from UNC file shares – With this method, you can save the latest definition and engine updates to a share on the network. Clients can then access the network to install the updates.  
  
 You can configure multiple definition update sources and control the order in which they are assessed and applied. This is done in the **Configure Definition Update Sources** dialog box when you create an antimalware policy.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  If you manage Windows 10 Technical Preview computers, then you must configure Endpoint Protection to update malware definitions for Windows Defender.  
  
#### How to Configure Definition Update Sources  
 Use the following procedure to configure the definition update sources to use for each antimalware policy.  
  
###### To configure definition update sources  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Assets and Compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Endpoint Protection**, and then click **Antimalware Policies**.  
  
3.  Open the properties page of the **Default Antimalware Policy** or create a new antimalware policy. For more information about how to create antimalware policies, see [How to create and deploy antimalware policies for Endpoint Protection in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-create-and-deploy-antimalware-policies-for-Endpoint-Protection-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
4.  In the **Definition updates** section of the antimalware properties dialog box, click **Set Source**.  
  
5.  In the **Configure Definition Update Sources** dialog box, select the sources to use for definition updates. You can click **Up** or **Down** to modify the order in which these sources are used.  
  
6.  Click **OK** to close the **Configure Definition Update Sources** dialog box.  
  
####  <a name="BKMK_EPsup"></a> Using Configuration Manager Software Updates to Deliver Definition Updates  
 You can configure [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] software updates to deliver definition updates to client computers. This is done by configuring automatic deployment rules. Before you begin to create automatic deployment rules, make sure that you have configured [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] software updates. For more information, see [Introduction to software updates in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Introduction-to-software-updates-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  This procedure is only for the items that must be specifically configured for [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)]. For more information about the Create Automatic Deployment Rule Wizard, see [Manage software updates in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Manage-software-updates-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
###### To configure an automatic deployment rule to deliver definition updates  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Software Library**.  
  
2.  In the **Software Library** workspace, expand **Software Updates**, and then click **Automatic Deployment Rules**.

    -   **Collection**: Select the collection of client computers to which you want to deploy definition updates.  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  You cannot deploy definition updates to a collection of users.  
  
5.  Click **Add to an existing Software Update Group**.  
  
6.  Make sure that the  **Enable the deployment after this rule is run** check box is selected, and then click **Next**.  
  
7.  On the **Deployment Settings** page of the wizard, in the **Detail level** list, select **Minimal**, and then click **Next**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  From the **Detail level** list, select **Minimal** ([!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] with no Service Pack) or **Only error messages** ([!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]). This will reduce the number of state messages returned by definition deployment. This configuration helps reduce the CPU processing usage on the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] servers.  
  
8.  In the **Property filters** list, select the **Update Classification** check box.  
  
9. In the **Search criteria** list, click **<items to find\>**. Then, in the **Search Criteria** dialog box, in the **Specify the value to search for** list, select **Definition Updates**.  
  
10. Click **OK** to close the **Search Criteria** dialog box.  
  
11. In the **Property filters** list, select the **Product** check box.  
  
12. In the **Search criteria** list, click **<items to find\>**. Then, in the **Search Criteria** dialog box, in the **Specify the value to search for** list, select **Forefront Endpoint Protection 2010** for Windows 8.1 and earlier or **Windows Defender** for Windows 10 and later.  
  
13. Click **OK** to close the **Search Criteria** dialog box, and then click **Next**.  
  
14. In the **Property filters** list, select the **Superseded** check box.  
  
15. In the **Search criteria** list, click **<items to find\>**. Then, in the **Search Criteria** dialog box, in the **Specify the value to search for** list, select **No**.  
  
16. Click **OK** to close the **Search Criteria** dialog box, and then click **Next**.  
  
17. On the **Evaluation Schedule** page of the wizard, select **Enable rule to run on a schedule**, and then configure the schedule by which to download definition updates. At a minimum, set the rule to run two hours after each software update point synchronization. Click **Next**.  
  
18. On the **Deployment Schedule** page of the wizard, configure the following settings:  
  
    -   **Time based on**: Select **UTC** if you want all clients in the hierarchy to install the latest definitions at the same time. The actual installation time will vary within a two-hour window. This setting is a recommended best practice.  
  
    -   **Software available time**: Specify the available time for the deployment that is created by this rule. The specified time must be at least one hour after the automatic deployment rule runs. This helps to ensure that the content has sufficient time to replicate to the distribution points in your hierarchy. Some definition updates might also include antimalware engine updates, which might take longer to reach distribution points.  
  
    -   **Installation deadline**: Select **As soon as possible**.  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  Software update deadlines are varied over a two-hour period to prevent all clients from requesting an update at the same time.  
  
19. Click **Next**.  
  
20. On the **User Experience** page of the wizard, in the **User notifications** list, select **Hide in Software Center and all notifications**.   This ensures that the definition updates install silently. Click **Next**.  
  
21. On the **Alerts** page of the wizard, you do not have to configure any alerts. [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] generates any alerts that might be required. Click **Next**.  
  
22. On the **Download Settings** page of the wizard, select the necessary software updates download behavior, and then click **Next**.  
  
23. On the **Deployment Package** page of the wizard, select an existing deployment package or create a new deployment package to contain the software update files associated with the rule.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  Consider placing definition updates in a package that does not contain other software updates. This strategy keeps the size of the definition update package smaller, which allows it to replicate to distribution points more quickly.  
  
24. On the **Distribution Points** page of the wizard, select one or more distribution points to which the content for this package will be copied, and then click **Next**.  
  
25. On the **Download Location** page of the wizard, select **Download software updates from the Internet**, and then click **Next**.  
  
26. On the **Language Selection** page of the wizard, select each language version of the updates to be downloaded, and then click **Next**.  
  
27. Complete the Create Automatic Deployment Rule Wizard.  
  
28. Verify that the new rule is displayed in the **Automatic Deployment Rules** node of the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console.  
  
#### Using Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) to Deliver Definitions  
 If you use WSUS to keep your antimalware definitions up to date, you can configure it to auto-approve definition updates. Although using [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] software updates is the recommended method to keep definitions up to date, you can also configure WSUS as a method to allow users to manually initiate definition updated. Use the following procedures to configure WSUS as a definition update source.  
  
##### Configuring Update Synchronization  
 To configure [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] software updates to synchronize [!INCLUDE[epshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/epshort_md.md)] definition updates, use the following procedure.
