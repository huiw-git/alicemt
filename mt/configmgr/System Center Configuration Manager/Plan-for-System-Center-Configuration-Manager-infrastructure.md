# Plan for System Center Configuration Manager infrastructure
When you plan for a new deployment of  [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)], there is no basic plan to follow that will assure success for all environments. Instead, you should  
  
-   Understand the scope of devices you want to manage  
  
-   Understand the  [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] capabilities you want to use  
  
-   Map those requirements  across your available network and cloud infrastructure  
  
 With clear goals and good information about your  available assets, you can then successfully plan the following:  
  
-   The number,  type, and relationship of sites you will use  
  
-   The number, type, and location of clients your design can support, and what infrastructure they require  
  
-   The geographic locations where you might install a site, or configure content management solutions within a site  
  
-   On which servers, and in which sites you will place different site system roles  
  
-   How you will configure role-based administration to grant administrative users access to only the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] infrastructure and objects they should see and manage  
  
 The following subjects can help get you started with planning sites and a hierarchy:
