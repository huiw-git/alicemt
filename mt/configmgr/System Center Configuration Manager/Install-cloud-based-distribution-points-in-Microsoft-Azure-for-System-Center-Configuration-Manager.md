# Install cloud-based distribution points in Microsoft Azure for System Center Configuration Manager
You can install [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] cloud-based distribution points in Microsoft Azure. If your unfamiliar with cloud-based distribution points, see [Use a cloud-based distribution point](../System Center Configuration Manager/Use-a-cloud-based-distribution-point-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) before continuing.
 
 Before you begin the install, make sure that you have the required certificate files:  
  
-   A Microsoft Azure management certificate that is exported to a .cer file and to a .pfx file.  
  
-   A [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] cloud-based distribution point service certificate that is exported to a .pfx file.  
  
    > [!TIP]
    >   For more information about these certificates, see the section for cloud-based distribution points in the [PKI certificate requirements for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/PKI-certificate-requirements-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) topic. For an example deployment of the cloud-based distribution point service certificate, see the [Deploying the Service Certificate for Cloud-Based Distribution Points](../Topic/Step-by-step%20example%20deployment%20of%20the%20PKI%20certificates%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager:%20Windows%20Server%202008%20Certification%20Authority.md#BKMK_clouddp2008_cm2012) in the [Step-by-step example deployment of the PKI certificates for System Center Configuration Manager: Windows Server 2008 Certification Authority](../Topic/Step-by-step%20example%20deployment%20of%20the%20PKI%20certificates%20for%20System%20Center%20Configuration%20Manager:%20Windows%20Server%202008%20Certification%20Authority.md) topic.  
 
 
 After you install the cloud-based distribution point, Microsoft Azure automatically generates a GUID for the service and appends this to the DNS suffix of **cloudapp.net**. Using this GUID, you must configure DNS with a DNS alias (CNAME record) to map the service name that you define in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] cloud-based distribution point service certificate to the automatically generated GUID.  
  
 If you use a proxy web server, you might have to configure proxy settings to enable communication with the cloud service that hosts the distribution point.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_ConfigWindowsAzureandInstallDP"></a> Configure Microsoft Azure and install cloud-based distribution points  
 Use the following procedures to configure Microsoft Azure to support distribution points, and then install the cloud-based distribution point in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
#### To configure a cloud service in Microsoft Azure for a distribution point  
  
1.  Open a web browser to the Microsoft Azure Management Portal, at https://manage.windowsazure.com, and access your Microsoft Azure account.  
  
2.  Click **Hosted Services, Storage Accounts & CDN**, and then select **Management Certificates**.  
  
3.  Right-click your subscription, and then select **Add Certificate**.  
  
4.  For **Certificate file**, specify the .cer file that contains the exported Microsoft Azure management certificate to use for this cloud service, and then click **OK**.  
  
 The management certificate is loaded in Microsoft Azure, and you can now install a cloud-based distribution point.  
  
#### To install a cloud-based distribution point for Configuration Manager  
  
1.  Complete the steps in the preceding procedure to configure a cloud service in Microsoft Azure with a management certificate.  
  
2.  In the **Administration** workspace of the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, expand **Cloud Services**, select **Cloud Distribution Points**, and then on the **Home** tab, click **Create Cloud Distribution Point**.  
  
3.  On the **General** page of the Create Cloud Distribution Point Wizard, configure the following:  
  
    -   Specify the **Subscription ID** for your Microsoft Azure account.  
  
        > [!TIP]  
        >  You can find your Microsoft Azure subscription ID in the Microsoft Azure Management Portal.  
  
    -   Specify the **Management certificate**. Click **Browse** to specify the .pfx file that contains the exported Microsoft Azure management certificate, and then enter the password for the certificate. Optionally, you can specify a version 1 .publishsettings file from the Microsoft Azure SDK 1.7  
  
4.  Click **Next**, and [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] connects to Microsoft Azure to validate the management certificate.  
  
5.  On the **Settings** page, complete the following configurations, and then click **Next**:  
  
    -   For **Region**, select the Microsoft Azure region where you want to create the cloud service that hosts this distribution point.  
  
    -   For **Certificate file**, specify the .pfx file that contains the exported [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] cloud-based distribution point service certificate, and then enter the password.  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  The **Service FQDN** box is automatically populated from the certificate Subject Name and in most cases, you do not have to edit it. The exception is if you are using a wildcard certificate in a testing environment, where the host name is not specified so that multiple computers that have the same DNS suffix can use the certificate. In this scenario, the certificate Subject contains a value similar to **CN=\*.contoso.com** and [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] displays a message that you must specify the correct FQDN. Click **OK** to close the message, and then enter a specific name before the DNS suffix to provide a complete FQDN. For example, you might add **clouddp1** to specify the complete service FQDN of **clouddp1.contoso.com**. The Service FQDN must be unique in your domain and not match any domain joined device.  
        >   
        >  Wildcard certificates are supported for testing environments only.  
  
6.  On the **Alerts** page, configure storage quotas, transfer quotas, and at what percentage of these quotas you want [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to generate alerts, and then click **Next**.  
  
7.  Complete the wizard.  
  
 The wizard creates a new hosted service for the cloud-based distribution point. After you close the wizard, you can monitor the installation progress of the cloud-based distribution point in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, or by monitoring the **CloudMgr.log** file on the primary site server. You can also monitor the provisioning of the cloud service in the Microsoft Azure Management Portal.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  It can take up to 30 minutes to provision a new distribution point in Microsoft Azure. The following message is repeated in the **CloudMgr.log** file until the storage account is provisioned: **Waiting for check if container exists. Will check again in 10 seconds**. Then, the service is created and configured.  
  
 You can identify that the cloud-based distribution point installation is completed by using the following methods:  
  
-   In the Microsoft Azure Management Portal, the **Deployment** for the cloud-based distribution point displays a status of **Ready**.  
  
-   In the **Administration** workspace, **Hierarchy Configuration**, **Cloud** node of the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, the cloud-based distribution point displays a status of **Ready**.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] displays a status message ID **9409** for the SMS_CLOUD_SERVICES_MANAGER component.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_ConfigDNSforCloudDPs"></a> Configure name resolution for cloud-based distribution points  
 Before clients can access the cloud-based distribution point, they must be able to resolve the name of the cloud-based distribution point to an IP address that Microsoft Azure manages. Clients do this in two stages:  
  
1.  They map the service name that you provided with the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] cloud-based distribution point service certificate to your Microsoft Azure service FQDN. This FQDN contains a GUID and the DNS suffix of **cloudapp.net**. The GUID is automatically generated after you install the cloud-based distribution point. You can see the full FQDN in the Microsoft Azure Management Portal, by referencing the **SITE URL** in the dashboard of the cloud service. An example site URL is **http://d1594d4527614a09b934d470.cloudapp.net**.  
  
2.  They resolve the Microsoft Azure service FQDN to the IP address that Microsoft Azure allocates. This IP address can also be identified in the dashboard for the cloud service in the Microsoft Azure portal, and is named **PUBLIC VIRTUAL IP ADDRESS (VIP)**.  
  
 To map the service name that you provided with the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] cloud-based distribution point service certificate (for example, **clouddp1.contoso.com**) to your Microsoft Azure service FQDN (for example, **d1594d4527614a09b934d470.cloudapp.net**), DNS servers on the Internet must have a DNS alias (CNAME record). Clients can then resolve the Microsoft Azure service FQDN to the IP address by using DNS servers on the Internet.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_ConfigProxyforCloud"></a> Configure proxy settings for primary sites that manage cloud services  
 When you use cloud services with [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)], the primary site that manages the cloud-based distribution point must be able to connect to the Microsoft Azure Management Portal by using the **System** account of the primary site computer. This connection is made by using the default web browser on the primary site server computer.  
  
 On the primary site server that manages the cloud-based distribution point, you might have to configure the proxy settings to enable the primary site to access the Internet and Microsoft Azure.  
  
 Use the following procedure to configure the proxy settings for the primary site server in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console.  
  
> [!TIP]  
>  You can also configure the proxy server when you install new site system roles on the primary site server by using the **Add Site System Roles Wizard**.  
  
#### To configure proxy settings for the primary site server  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Administration**.  
  
2.  In the **Administration** workspace, expand **Site Configuration**, click **Servers and Site System Roles**, and then select the primary site server that manages the cloud-based distribution point.  
  
3.  In the details pane, right-click **Site system**, and then click **Properties**.  
  
4.  In **Site System Properties**, select the **Proxy** tab, and then configure the proxy settings for this primary site server.  
  
5.  Click **OK** to save the new proxy server configuration.
