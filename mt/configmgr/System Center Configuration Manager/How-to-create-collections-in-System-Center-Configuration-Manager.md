# How to create collections in System Center Configuration Manager
Create collections in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] to represent logical groupings of users or devices. You can use collections to help you perform many tasks including application management, deploying compliance settings, or installing software updates. You can also use collections to manage groups of client settings or use them with role-based administration to specify the resources that an administrative user can access. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] contains several built-in collections. For more information, see [Introduction to collections in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Introduction-to-collections-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  A single collection can contain users or devices, but not both.  
  
 The following table lists the rules that you can use to configure the members of a collection in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)].  
  
|Membership rule type|More information|  
|--------------------------|----------------------|  
|Direct rule|Direct rules let you choose the users or computers that you want to add as members to a collection. This rule gives you direct control over which resources are members of the collection. This membership does not change unless a resource is removed from [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] must have discovered the resources or you must have imported the resources before you can add them to a direct rule collection. Direct rule collections have a higher administrative overhead than query rule collections because you must make changes to this collection type manually.|  
|Query rule|Query rules dynamically update the membership of a collection based on a query that [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] runs on a schedule. For example, you can create a collection of users that are a member of the Human Resources organizational unit in Active Directory Domain Services. Unlike direct rule collections, this collection membership is automatically updated when new users are added to or removed from the Human Resources organizational unit.<br /><br /> For example queries that you can use to build collections, see [How to create queries in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-create-queries-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).|  
|Include collection rule|The include collection rule let you include the members of another collection in a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] collection The membership of the current collection is updated on a schedule if the membership of the included collection has changed.<br /><br /> You can add multiple include collection rules to a collection.<br />              **Example:** You create a collection that has two include collection rules. The first include collection rule is for a collection of laptops and the second include collection rule is for a collection of desktops. The new collection will contain all the members in the laptop collection and the desktop collection.|  
|Exclude collection rule|The exclude collection rule let you exclude the members of another collection from a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] collection. The membership of the current collection is updated on a schedule if the membership of the excluded collection has changed.<br /><br /> You can add multiple exclude collection rules to a collection. If a collection includes both include collection and exclude collection rules and there is a conflict, the exclude collection rule takes priority over the include collection rule.<br />              **Example:** You create a collection that has one include collection rule and one exclude collection rule. The include collection rule is for a collection of Dell desktops. The exclude collection is for a collection of computers that have less than 4 GB RAM. The new collection will contain Dell desktops that have at least 4 GB RAM.|  
  
 Use the following procedures to help you create collections in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)]. You can also import collections that were created at this or another [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] site. For information about how to export collections, see [How to manage collections in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-manage-collections-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
 For information about creating collections for computers that run Linux and UNIX, see [How to manage clients for Linux and UNIX servers in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-manage-clients-for-Linux-and-UNIX-servers-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_1"></a> To create a device collection  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, click **Assets and Compliance**.  
  
2.  In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, click **Device Collections**.  
  
3.  On the **Home** tab, in the **Create** group, click **Create Device Collection**.  
  
4.  On the **General** page of the **Create Device Collection Wizard**, specify the following information:  
  
    -   **Name**: Specify a unique name for the collection.  
  
    -   **Comment**: Specify a description for the collection.  
  
    -   **Limiting collection**: Click **Browse** to select a limiting collection. The collection that you are creating will only contain members from the limiting collection.  
  
5.  On the **Membership Rules** page of the **Create Device Collection Wizard**, specify the following information:  
  
    -   In the **Add Rule** list, select the type of membership rule that you want to use for this collection. You can configure multiple rules for each collection.  
  
         Use the following procedures to configure each membership rule type.  
  
        ##### To configure a direct rule  
  
        1.  On the **Search for Resources** page of the **Create Direct Membership Rule Wizard**, specify the following information:  
  
            -   **Resource class**: In the list, select the type of resource you want to search for and add to the collection. Select from **System Resource** values to search for inventory data returned from client computers or **Unknown Computer** to select from values returned by unknown computers.  
  
            -   **Attribute name**: In the list, select the attribute associated with the selected resource class that you want to search for. For example, if you want to select computers by their NetBIOS name, select **System Resource** in the **Resource class** list and **NetBIOS name** in the **Attribute name** list.  
  
            -   **Exclude resources marked as obsolete** – If a client computer is marked as obsolete, do not include this value in the search results.  
  
            -   **Exclude resources that do not have the Configuration Manager client installed** – If the search results include a resource that does not have a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client installed, this value will not be displayed in the search results.  
  
            -   **Value:** Enter a value for which you want to search the selected attribute name. You can use the percent character **%** as a wildcard. For example, if you wanted to search for computers that have a NetBIOS name beginning with ‘M’, enter **M%** in this field.  
  
        2.  On the **Select Resources** page of the **Create Direct Membership Rule Wizard**, select the resources that you want to add to the collection in the **Resources** list, and then click **Next**.  
  
        3.  Complete the **Create Direct Membership Rule Wizard**.  
  
        ##### To configure a query rule  
  
        1.  In the **Query Rule Properties** dialog box, specify the following information:  
  
            -   **Name**: Specify a unique name for the query rule.  
  
            -   **Import Query Statement** – Opens the **Browse Query** dialog box where you can select a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] query to use as the query rule for the collection. For more information about how to create these queries and some examples, see [How to create queries in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-create-queries-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
            -   **Resource class:** In the list, select the type of resource you want to search for and add to the collection. Select a value from **System Resource** values to search for inventory data returned from client computers or **Unknown Computer** to select from values returned by unknown computers.  
  
            -   **Edit Query Statement** – Opens the **Query Statement Properties** dialog box where you can author a query to use as the rule for the collection. For more information about queries, see [Queries technical reference for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Queries-technical-reference-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
        2.  Click **OK** to close the **Query Rule Properties** dialog box and to save the query membership rule.  
  
        ##### To configure an include collection rule  
  
        1.  In the **Select Collections** dialog box, select the collections you want to include in the new collection.  
  
        2.  Click **OK** to close the **Select Collections** dialog box and to save the include membership rule.  
  
        ##### To configure an exclude collection rule  
  
        1.  In the **Select Collections** dialog box, select the collections you want to exclude from the new collection.  
  
        2.  Click **OK** to close the **Select Collections** dialog box and to save the exclude membership rule.  
  
    -   **Use incremental updates for this collection** – Select this option to periodically scan for only new or changed resources from the previous collection evaluation and update the collection membership with only these resources, independently of a full collection evaluation. Incremental updates occur at 10 minute intervals.  
  
        > [!IMPORTANT]  
        >  Collections configured by using query rules that use the following classes do not support incremental updates:  
        >   
        >  -   SMS_G_System_CollectedFile  
        > -   SMS_G_System_LastSoftwareScan  
        > -   SMS_G_System_AppClientState  
        > -   SMS_G_System_DCMDeploymentState  
        > -   SMS_G_System_DCMDeploymentErrorAssetDetails

        > -   SMS_GH_System_*  
        > -   SMS_GEH_System_*  
  
    -   **Schedule a full update on this collection** – Select this option to schedule a regular full evaluation of the collection membership.  
  
6.  Complete the wizard to create the new collection. The new collection is displayed in the **Device Collections** node of the **Assets and Compliance** workspace.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You must refresh or reload the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console to see the collection members. However, the members will not appear in the collection until after the first scheduled update, or you manually select **Update Membership** for the collection. Depending on the complexity of the collection rule and the number of entries in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] database, it can take a few minutes for a collection update to complete.
