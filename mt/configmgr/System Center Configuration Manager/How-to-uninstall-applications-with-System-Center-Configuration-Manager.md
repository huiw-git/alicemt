# How to uninstall applications with System Center Configuration Manager
Perform the following steps to uninstall an application by using [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)]:  
  
-   Specify the command line to uninstall the deployment type content on the **Content** page of the **Create Deployment Type Wizard**.  
  
-   Deploy the application by using a deployment action of **Uninstall**.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Some application types do not support uninstallation.  
  
 The following list gives more information about the application uninstall behavior:  
  
-   When you uninstall a [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] application, any dependent applications are not automatically uninstalled.  
  
-   If you deploy an application that uses an action of **Uninstall** to a user, and the application was installed for all users of the computer, then the uninstall might fail if the userâ€™s account does not have permissions to uninstall the application.  
  
-   If you remove a user or device from a collection that has an application deployed to it, the application will not be automatically removed from the device.  
  
-   A deployment with the deployment purpose of **Uninstall** does not check requirement rules. If the application is installed on the computer on which the deployment runs, it will be uninstalled.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must delete any existing deployments or simulated deployments of an application to a collection before you can deploy the application with a deployment action of **Uninstall**.  
  
 For more information about how to create a deployment type, see [How to create applications with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-create-applications-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
 For more information about how to deploy an application, see [How to deploy applications with System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-deploy-applications-with-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
### To uninstall an application  
  
1.  Configure the application deployment type with the uninstall command line by using one of the following methods:  
  
    -   On the **General** page of the **Create Deployment Wizard**, select the option **Automatically identify information about this deployment type from installation files**. If the information is available in the installation files, the uninstall command line is automatically added to the deployment type properties.  
  
    -   On the **Content** page of the **Create Deployment Type Wizard**, in the **Uninstall program** field, specify the command line to uninstall the application.  
  
        > [!NOTE]  
        >  The **Content** page is displayed only if you select the option **Manually specify the deployment type information** on the **General** page of the **Create Deployment Type Wizard**.  
  
    -   In the **Programs** tab of the *<deployment type name\>***Properties** dialog box specify the command line to uninstall the application in the **Uninstall program** field.  
  
2.  Deploy the application and select the deployment action **Uninstall** from the **Deployment Settings** page of the **Deploy Software Wizard**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  When you select a deployment action of **Uninstall**, the deployment purpose is automatically configured as **Required**.
