# iOS hybrid enrollment using Apple Configurator with Configuration Manager
Companies that buy iOS devices to be used by employees can manage them using Microsoft Intune. You can pre-enroll iOS devices by USB-connecting them to a Mac PC running Apple Configurator. Before enrolling, you must prepare an Intune corporate-enrolled device profile in the Intune admin console and export it to the Mac PC. The enrollment process will factory reset the device and go through the Setup Assistant process to configure the device. The following procedure is recommended for dedicated iOS devices that will have a single user who uses the device to access company email and company resources such as apps and date.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_SAE"></a> Apple Configurator enrollment via Setup Assistant  
 Using Apple Configurator, you can factory reset iOS devices and prepares them for setup by the device’s new user.  This method requires you to USB-connect the iOS device to a Mac computer to setup corporate enrollment and assumes you are using Apple Configurator 2.0.  
  
 **Prerequisites**  
  
-   Physical access to iOS devices  
  
-   Device serial numbers - [How to get an iOS serial number](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204308)  
  
-   USB connection cables  
  
-   Mac computer with [Apple Configurator 2.0](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518017)  
  
#### Enable Setup Assistant enrollment with Configuration Manager and Intune  
  
1.  **Add a Corporate Device Enrollment profile**   
    In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, in the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Overview**, expand **All Corporate-owned Devices**, expand **iOS**, and click **Enrollment Profiles**. Click **Create Profile** on the **Home** tab to open the Create Profile wizard. Configure the settings on the following pages:  
  
    1.  On the **General** page, specify the following information, and then click **Next**.  
  
        -   **Name** – Name of the device enrollment profile. (Not visible to users)  
  
        -   **Description** - Description of the device enrollment profile. (Not visible to users)  
  
        -   **User affinity** – Specifies how devices are enrolled. For most Setup Assistant scenarios, use **Prompt for user affinity**.  
  
            -   **Prompt for user affinity**: The device must be affiliated with a user during initial setup and could then be permitted to access company data and email as that user.  
  
            -   **No user affinity**: The device is not affiliated with a user. Use this affiliation for devices that perform tasks without accessing local user data. Apps requiring user affiliation won’t work.  
  
    2.  On the **Device Enrollment Program** page, leave the **Configure Device Enrollment Program settings for this profile** checkbox unchecked, and click **Next**.  
  
    3.  Review the Summary and then click net.  
  
2.  **Add iOS devices to enroll with Setup assistant**   
    In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, in the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Overview**, expand **All Corporate-owned Devices**, expand **iOS**, and click **Device Information**. and then click **Add devices**. You can add devices in two ways:  
  
    -   **Upload a CSV file containing serial numbers** – Create a comma-separated value (.csv) list of two columns without a header, limited to 5000 devices or 5MB per csv file.  
  
        |||  
        |-|-|  
        |<Serial #1>|<Device #1 Details>|  
        |<Serial#2>|<Device #2 Details>|  
  
         This .csv file when viewed in a text editor appears as:  
  
        ```  
        0000000,PO 1234  
        111111111,PO 1234  
        ```  
  
    -   **Manually add serial numbers and details** - Enter the serial number and device details of up to five devices  
  
     And then click **Next**.  
  
3.  **Select devices to enroll**   
    Confirm the devices to enroll. Serial numbers already enrolled or enrolled by other means cannot be imported. Click **Next** to continue.  
  
4.  **Assign profile**   
    Specify the profile to assign to added devices from the list of available profiles, review the **Enrollment profile details**, and then click **Finish**. Manually added devices can be assigned to any Enrollment profile, but DEP-synced devices must be assigned to a DEP-enabled profile.  
  
5.  **Select a profile to deploy to iOS devices**   
    In the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console, in the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, expand **Overview**, expand **All Corporate-owned Devices**, expand **iOS**, and click **Enrollment Profiles**, and then select the device profile to deploy to mobile devices. Click **Export…** in the taskbar. Copy and save the **Profile URL**. You will upload it in Apple Configurator later to define the Intune profile used by iOS devices.  The enrollment profile URL is valid for two weeks from when it is exported. After two weeks, you must export a new URL file to enroll iOS devices.  
  
     To support Apple Configurator 2, the 2.0 Profile URL must be edited. Replace:  
  
    ```  
    https://manage.microsoft.com/EnrollmentServer/Discovery.svc/iOS/ESProxy?id=  
  
    ```  
  
     with  
  
    ```  
    https://appleconfigurator2.manage.microsoft.com/MDMServiceConfig?id=  
  
    ```  
  
6.  **Prepare the device with Apple Configurator**   
    iOS devices are connected to the Mac computer and enrolled for mobile device management.  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    >  The devices will be reset to factory configurations during the enrollment process.  
  
    1.  On a Mac computer, open **Apple Configurator 2**.  In the menu bar, click **Apple Configurator 2**, and click **Preferences**.  
  
    2.  In the preferences pane, select **Servers** and click the "+" symbol below the left pane to launch the MDM Server wizard. Click **Next**.  
  
    3.  Enter the **Name** and **Enrollment URL** for the MDM server from the step #5 above. Click **Next**.  
  
         If you receive a warning about trust profile requirements for Apple TV, you may safely cancel the **Trust Profile** option by clicking the grey "X". You can also safely disregard any Anchor certificate warning. To continue, click **Next** until the wizard is complete.  
  
    4.  On the **Servers** pane, click “Edit” beside the new server’s profile. Ensure that the Enrollment URL exactly matches the URL exported from Intune. Reenter the original URL if it is different and **Save** the enrollment profile exported from Intune.  
  
    5.  Connect the iOS mobile devices to the Apple computer with a USB adapter.  
  
        > [!WARNING]  
        >  The devices will be reset to factory configurations during the enrollment process. As a best practice, reset the device and power it on. As a best practice, devices should be at the Hello screen when you start Setup Assistant.  
  
    6.  Click **Prepare**. On the **Prepare iOS Device** pane, select **Manual** and then click **Next**.  
  
    7.  On the **Enroll in MDM Server** pane, select the server name you created and then click **Next**.  
  
    8.  On the **Enroll in MDM Server** pane, select the server name you created and then click **Next**.  
  
    9. On the **Create an Organization** pane, choose the **Organization** or create a new organization, and then click **Next**.  
  
    10. On the **Configure iOS Setup Assistant** pane, choose the steps presented to the user, and then click **Prepare**. If prompted, authenticate to update trust settings.  
  
    11. When the iOS device finishes preparing, you can disconnect the USB cable.  
  
7.  **Distribute devices**   
    The devices are now ready for corporate enrollment. Power down the devices and distribute them to users. When the device is turned on, the setup assistant will start and prompt the user for their work or school account.
