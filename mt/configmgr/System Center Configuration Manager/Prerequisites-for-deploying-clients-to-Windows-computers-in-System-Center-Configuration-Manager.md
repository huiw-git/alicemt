# Prerequisites for deploying clients to Windows computers in System Center Configuration Manager
Deploying [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] clients in your environment has the following external dependencies and dependencies within the product. Additionally, each client deployment method has its own dependencies that must be met for client installations to be successful.  
  
 Use the following sections to determine the prerequisites to install the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client on computers and mobile devices:  
  
-   [Prerequisites for Computer Clients](#BKMK_prereqs_computers)  
  
-   [Prerequisites for Mobile Device Clients](#BKMK_prereqs_mobiledevices)  
  
 Make sure that you also review [Supported configurations for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Supported-configurations-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) to confirm that devices meet the minimum hardware and operating system requirements for the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client.  
  
 For information about the prerequisites for the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client for Linux and UNIX, see  [Planning for client deployment to Linux and UNIX computers in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Planning-for-client-deployment-to-Linux-and-UNIX-computers-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  The software version numbers shown in this article only list the minimum version numbers required.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_prereqs_computers"></a> Prerequisites for Computer Clients  
 Use the following information to determine the prerequisites for when you install the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client on computers.  
  
### Dependencies External to Configuration Manager  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Windows Installer version 3.1.4000.2435|Required to support the use of Windows Installer update (.msp) files for packages and software updates.|  
|[KB2552033](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=240048)|Install this hotfix on site servers that run Windows Server 2008 R2 when client push installation is enabled.|  
|Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) version 2.5|Required to allow throttled data transfers between the client computer and [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] site systems. BITS is not automatically downloaded during client installation. When BITS is installed on computers, a restart is typically required to complete the installation.<br /><br /> Most operating systems include BITS, but if they do not (for example, Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2), you must install BITS before you install the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client.|  
|Microsoft Task Scheduler|Enable this  service on the client for the client installation to complete.|  
  
### Dependencies External to Configuration Manager and Automatically Downloaded During Installation  
 The [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client has some potential external dependencies. These dependencies depend on the operating system and the installed software on the client computer.  
  
 If these dependencies are required to complete the installation of the client, they are automatically installed with the client software.  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Windows Update Agent version 7.0.6000.363|Required by Windows to support update detection and deployment.|  
|Microsoft Core XML Services (MSXML) version 6.20.5002 or later|Required to support the processing of XML documents in Windows.|  
|Microsoft Remote Differential Compression (RDC)|Required to optimize data transmission over the network.|  
|Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable version 12.0.21005.1|Required to support client operations. When this update is installed on client computers, a restart might be required to complete the installation.|  
|Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable version 8.0.50727.42|Required to support Microsoft SQL Server Compact operations.|  
|Windows Imaging APIs 6.0.6001.18000|Required to allow [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to manage Windows image (.wim) files.|  
|Microsoft Policy Platform 1.2.3514.0|Required to allow clients to evaluate compliance settings.|  
|Microsoft Silverlight 5.1.41212.0 (beginning in [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] version 1602)|Required to support the Application Catalog website user experience.|  
|Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5.2|Required to support client operations. Automatically installed on the client computer if it does not have Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 or later installed. For more information, see [Additional details about Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5.2](#dotNet).|  
|Microsoft SQL Server Compact 3.5 SP2 components|Required to store information related to client operations.|  
|Microsoft Windows Imaging Components|Required by Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 for Windows Server 2003 or Windows XP SP2 for 64-bit computers.|  
  
####  <a name="dotNet"></a> Additional details about Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5.2  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  On January 12th of 2016, support for .NET 4.0, 4.5, and 4.5.1 expired. For more information, see [Microsoft .NET Framework Support Lifecycle Policy FAQ](https://support.microsoft.com/gp/framework_faq?WT.mc_id=azurebg_email_Trans_943_NET452_Update) at support.microsoft.com.  
  
 A restart may be required to complete the installation of Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5.2. The user will see **Restart required** notification in the system tray.  Common scenarios that require client computers to be restarted:  
  
-   .NET applications or services are running on the computer.  
  
-   One or more software updates required for .NET installation are missing.  
  
-   The computer is pending a restart from prior installation of .NET framework software updates.  
  
 After  .NET Framework 4.5.2 is installed, additional updates to it might be installed subsequently, which may require addition computer restarts.  
  
### Configuration Manager Dependencies  
 For more information about the following site system roles, see [Determine the site system roles for System Center Configuration Manager clients](../System Center Configuration Manager/Determine-the-site-system-roles-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-clients.md)  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|Management point|Although a management point is not required to deploy the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client, you must have a management point to transfer information between client computers and [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] servers. Without a management point, you cannot manage client computers.|  
|Distribution point|The distribution point is an optional, but recommended site system role for client deployment. All distribution points host the client source files, which lets computers find the nearest distribution point from which to download the client source files during client deployment. If the site does not have a distribution point, computers download the client source files from their management point.|  
|Fallback status point|The fallback status point is an optional, but recommended site system role for client deployment. The fallback status point tracks client deployment and enables computers in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] site to send state messages when they cannot communicate with a management point.|  
|Reporting services point|The reporting services point is an optional, but recommended site system role that can display reports related to client deployment and management. For more information, see [Reporting in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Reporting-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).|

     You must be a member of the **Full Administrator** security role to configure automatic client upgrades.  
  
### Firewall Requirements  
 If there is a firewall between the site system servers and the computers onto which you want to install the Configuration Manager client, see [Windows Firewall and port settings for clients in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Windows-Firewall-and-port-settings-for-clients-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_prereqs_mobiledevices"></a> Prerequisites for Mobile Device Clients  
 Use the following information to determine the prerequisites for when you install the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client on mobile devices and use [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] to enroll them.  
  
### Dependencies External to Configuration Manager  
  
-   A Microsoft enterprise certification authority (CA) with certificate templates to deploy and manage the certificates required for mobile devices.  
  
     The issuing CA must automatically approve certificate requests from the mobile device users during the enrollment process.  
  
     For more information about the certificate requirements, see [Security and privacy for certificate profiles in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Security-and-privacy-for-certificate-profiles-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
-   A security group that contains the users that can enroll their mobile devices.  
  
     This security group is used to configure the certificate template that is used during mobile device enrollment.  
  
-   Optional but recommended: a DNS alias (CNAME record) named **ConfigMgrEnroll** that is configured for the site system server name on which you will install the enrollment proxy point.  
  
     This DNS alias is required to support automatic discovery for the enrollment service: If you do not configure this DNS record, users must manually specify the site system server name of the enrollment proxy point as part of the enrollment process.  
  
-   Site system role dependencies for the computers that will run the enrollment point and the enrollment proxy point site system roles.  
  
     See  [Supported operating systems for site system servers](../System Center Configuration Manager/Supported-operating-systems-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager--site-system-servers.md).  
  
### Configuration Manager Dependencies  
 For more information about the following site system roles, see [Determine the site system roles for System Center Configuration Manager clients](../System Center Configuration Manager/Determine-the-site-system-roles-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager-clients.md).  
  
-   Management point that is configured for HTTPS client connections and enabled for mobile devices  
  
     A management point is always required to install the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] client on mobile devices. In addition to the configuration requirements of HTTPS and enabled for mobile devices, the management point must be configured with an Internet FQDN and accept client connections from the Internet.  
  
-   Enrollment point and enrollment proxy point  
  
     An enrollment proxy point manages enrollment requests from mobile devices and the enrollment point completes the enrollment process. The enrollment point must be in the same Active Directory forest as the site server, but the enrollment proxy point can be in another forest.  
  
-   Client settings for mobile device enrollment  
  
     Configure client settings to allow users to enroll mobile devices and configure at least one enrollment profile.  
  
-   Reporting services point  
  
     The reporting services point is an optional, but recommended site system role that can display reports related to mobile device enrollment and client management.  
  
     For more information, see [Reporting in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Reporting-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
-   To configure enrollment for mobile devices, you must have the following security permissions:  
  
    -   To add, modify, and delete the enrollment site system roles: **Modify** permission for the **Site** object.  
  
    -   To configure client settings for enrollment: Default client settings require **Modify** permission for the **Site** object, and custom client settings require **Client agent**  permissions.  
  
     The **Full Administrator** security role includes the required permissions to configure the enrollment site system roles.  
  
     To manage enrolled mobile devices, you must have the following security permissions:  
  
    -   To wipe or retire a mobile device: **Delete resource** for the **Collection** object.  
  
    -   To cancel a wipe or retire command: **Delete resource** for the **Collection** object.  
  
    -   To allow and block mobile devices: **Modify resource** for the **Collection** object.  
  
    -   To remote lock, or reset the passcode on a mobile device: **Modify** resource for the **Collection** object.  
  
     The **Operations Administrator** security role includes the required permissions to manage mobile devices.  
  
     For more information about how to configure security permissions, see [Fundamentals of role-based administration for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Fundamentals-of-role-based-administration-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md) and  [Configure role-based administration for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/Configure-role-based-administration-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
### Firewall Requirements  
 Intervening network devices such as routers and firewalls, and Windows Firewall if applicable, must allow the traffic associated with mobile device enrollment:  
  
-   Between mobile devices and the enrollment proxy point: HTTPS (by default, TCP 443)  
  
-   Between the enrollment proxy point and the enrollment point: HTTPS (by default, TCP 443)  
  
 If you use a proxy web server, it must be configured for SSL tunneling; SSL bridging is not supported for mobile devices.
