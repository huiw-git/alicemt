# How to manage collections in System Center Configuration Manager
Use the overview information in this topic to help you perform management tasks for collections in [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  For information about how to create [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] collections, see [How to create collections in System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/How-to-create-collections-in-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md).  
  
## How to manage device collections  
 In the **Assets and Compliance** workspace, select **Device Collections**, select the collection to manage, and then select a management task.  
  
 Use the following table for more information about the management tasks that might require some information before you select them.
