# How to configure device settings with On-premises Mobile Device Management in System Center Configuration Manager
Once devices have been enrolled with        [!INCLUDE[onprem_first](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/onprem_first_md.md)], whether users have enrolled the devices themselves or you have bulk-enrolled them, you can begin managing them using the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] console using the same functionality you use to manage client-based computers in your organization.  
  
 The table below lists common management tasks for mobile devices and where to look for more information in the [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] documentation.
