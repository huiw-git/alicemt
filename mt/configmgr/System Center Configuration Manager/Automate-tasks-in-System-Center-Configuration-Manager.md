# Automate tasks in System Center Configuration Manager
You can create task sequences that automate  a variety of tasks within your [!INCLUDE[cm6long](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] environment. These tasks range from capturing an operating system on a reference computer to deploying the operating system to one or more destination computers.
