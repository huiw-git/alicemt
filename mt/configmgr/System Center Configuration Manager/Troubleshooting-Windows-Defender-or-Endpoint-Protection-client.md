##  <a name="BKMK_Install"></a> Install the Endpoint Protection client  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Windows Defender is installed with the operating system on Windows 10 PC's.  
  
 **Symptoms**  
  
 Installation fails for an unknown reason, or you receive an error message with error code, such as 0x80070643, 0X8007064A, 0x8004FF2E, 0x8004FF01, 0x8004FF07, 0x80070002, 0x8007064C, 0x8004FF00, 0x80070001, 0x80070656, 0x8004FF40, 0xC0000156, 0x8004FF41 0x8004FF0B, 0x8004FF11, 0x80240022, 0x8004FF04, 0x80070660, 0x800106B5, 0x80070715, 0x80070005, 0x8004EE00, 0x8007003, 0x800B0100, 0x8007064E, or 0x8007007E.  
  
 If your computer is running Windows XP Service Pack 2 (SP2), you might see one or more of the following error messages:  
  
-   Installation Wizard is missing a filter manager rollup package needed to complete the installation.  
  
-   KB914882 Setup Error, Setup cannot update your Windows XP files because the language installed on your system is different from the update language.  
  
 **Cause**  
  
 Endpoint Protection cannot be installed on a computer that is running other security programs. Sometimes, even if you remove other security programs, they do not completely uninstall. You must be running a genuine version of the Windows operating system to install Endpoint Protection.

##  <a name="BKMK_Update"></a> Update Windows Defender or Endpoint Protection  
 Windows Defender or  
      Endpoint Protection works automatically with Microsoft Update to ensure that your virus and spyware definitions are kept up to date.  
  
 **Symptoms**  
  
 This article addresses common issues with automatic updates, including the following situations:

-   Even though you are connected to the Internet, the updates fail.  
  
-   Updates are not automatically installing as scheduled.  
  
 **Cause**  
  
 The most common causes for update issues are problems with Internet connectivity. However, if you know you are connected to the Internet because you can browse to other Web sites, the issue might be caused by conflicts with your settings in Windows Internet Explorer.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]

3.  If you use a cable modem or DSL router, make sure the connections to the router and to the computer are firmly connected. Try unplugging and turning off the router and modem. Wait a few minutes, plug in the modem in first, wait one minute, then plug in the router, and restart your computer.  
  
##  <a name="BKMK_Detected"></a> Detected threat can't be remediated  
 When Windows Defender or  
      Endpoint Protection detects a potential threat that's hiding inside a compressed file with a .zip file name extension or within a network share, it tries to deal with the threat by quarantining or removing the threat.  
  
#### Remove or scan the file  
  
-   If the detected threat was in a .zip file, browse to the .zip file, and then either remove the file or scan it by right-clicking the file and selecting **Scan with Windows Defender** or **Scan with Endpoint Protection**. If Windows Defender or Endpoint Protection detects additional threats in the file, it notifies you about these threats and enables you to choose an appropriate action.  
  
-   If the detected threat was in a network share, browse to the network share and scan it by right-clicking the file and selecting **Scan with Windows Defender** or **Scan with Endpoint Protection**. If Windows Defender or Endpoint Protection detects additional threats in the network share, it notifies you about these threats and enables you to choose an appropriate action.  
  
-   If you're not sure of the file's origin, one of the best solutions is to run a full scan on your computer. A full scan may take some time to complete, but it makes it possible for Windows Defender or Endpoint Protection to look for the source of the infection and clean it.
