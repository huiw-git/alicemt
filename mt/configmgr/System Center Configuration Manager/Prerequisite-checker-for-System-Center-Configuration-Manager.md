# Prerequisite checker for System Center Configuration Manager

 Before you run Setup to install or upgrade a [!INCLUDE[cm6long_md](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cm6long_md.md)] site, or before you install a site system role on a new server, you can use this stand-alone application (**Prereqchk.exe**) from the version of [!INCLUDE[cmshort](../System Center Configuration Manager/itokens/cmshort_md.md)] that you want use to verify server readiness. The use of prerequisite checker enables you to identify and fix problems that would block an actual site or site system role installation.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Prerequisite checker always runs as part of Setup.  
  
 By default, when prerequisite checker runs:  
  
-   It validates the server where it runs  
  
-   The local computer is scanned for an existing site server, and only the checks that are applicable to the site are run  
  
-   If no existing sites are detected, all prerequisite rules are run  
  
-   It checks rules to verify that software and settings required for setup are installed. It is possible that required software requires additional configurations or software updates that are not verified by the prerequisite checker  
  
-   It logs its results in the **ConfigMgrPrereq.log** file on the system drive of computer. The log file can contain additional information that does not display in user interface.  
  
 When you run prerequisite checker at a command prompt and specify specific command-line options:  
  
-   Prerequisite checker only performs the checks that are associated with the site server or site systems that you specified in the command line  
  
-   To check a remote computer, your User account must have Administrative rights to the remove computer  
  
 For more information about the prerequisite checks that prerequisite checker performs, see [List of Prerequisite Checks for System Center Configuration Manager](../System Center Configuration Manager/List-of-Prerequisite-Checks-for-System-Center-Configuration-Manager.md)  
  
## Copy prerequisite checker files to another computer  
  
1.  In Windows Explorer, browse to one of the following locations:  
  
    -   **<ConfigMgrInstallationMedia\>\SMSSETUP\BIN\X64**  
  
    -   **<ConfigMgrInstallationPath\>\BIN\X64**  
  
2.  Copy the following files to the destination folder on the other computer:  
  
    -   Prereqchk.exe  
  
    -   Prereqcore.dll  
  
    -   Basesql.dll  
  
    -   Basesvr.dll  
  
    -   Baseutil.dll  
  
##  Run prerequisite checker with default checks  
  
1.  In Windows Explorer, browse to one of the following locations:  
  
    -   **<ConfigMgrInstallationMedia\>\SMSSETUP\BIN\X64**  
  
    -   **<ConfigMgrInstallationPath\>\BIN\X64**  
  
2.  Run **prereqchk.exe** to start Prerequisite Checker.   
    Prerequisite Checker detects existing sites, and if found, performs checks for upgrade readiness. If no sites are found, all checks are performed. The **Site Type** column provides information about the site server or site system with which the rule is associated.  
  
##  Run prerequisite checker from a command prompt for all default checks  
  
1.  Open a Command Prompt window and change directories to one of the following locations:  
  
    -   **<ConfigMgrInstallationMedia\>\SMSSETUP\BIN\X64**  
  
    -   **<ConfigMgrInstallationPath\>\BIN\X64**  
  
2.  Enter  **prereqchk.exe /LOCAL** to start Prerequisite Checker and run all prerequisite checks on the server.  
  
## Run prerequisite checker from a command prompt  for specified options  
  
1.  Open a Command Prompt window and change directories to one of the following locations:  
  
    -   **<ConfigMgrInstallationMedia\>\SMSSETUP\BIN\X64**  
  
    -   **<ConfigMgrInstallationPath\>\BIN\X64**  
  
2.  Enter  **prereqchk.exe** with the addition of one or more of the following command-line options.  
  
     For example, to check a primary site you might use the following:
