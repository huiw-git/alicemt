# Endpoint Protection Client Help
This version of Endpoint Protection includes the following new features and enhancements to better help protect your computer from threats:  
  
-   **Windows Firewall integration.** Endpoint Protection setup enables you to turn on or off Windows Firewall.  
  
-   **Network Inspection System.** This feature enhances real-time protection by inspecting network traffic to help proactively block exploitation of known network-based vulnerabilities.  
  
-   **New and improved protection engine.** The updated engine offers enhanced detection and cleanup capabilities with better performance.  
  
 These features are described in more detail in the following sections.  
  
## Windows Firewall integration  
 Windows Firewall can help prevent attackers or malicious software from gaining access to your computer through the Internet or a network. Now when you install Endpoint Protection, the installation wizard verifies that Windows Firewall is turned on. If you have intentionally turned off Windows Firewall, you can avoid turning it on by clearing a check box. You can change your Windows Firewall settings at any time via the System and Security settings in Control Panel.  
  
## Network Inspection System  
 Attackers are increasingly carrying out network-based attacks against exposed vulnerabilities before software vendors can develop and distribute security updates. Studies of vulnerabilities show that it can take a month or longer from the time of an initial attack report before a suitable security update is developed, tested, and released. This gap in protection leaves many computers vulnerable to attacks and exploitation for a substantial period of time. Network Inspection System works with real-time protection to better protect you against network-based attacks by greatly reducing the timespan between vulnerability disclosures and update deployment from weeks to a few hours.  
  
## Award-winning protection engine  
 Under the hood of Endpoint Protection is its award-winning protection engine that is updated regularly. The engine is backed by a team of antimalware researchers from the Microsoft Malware Protection Center, providing responses to the latest malware threats 24 hours a day.
