# Install Orchestrator
This section provides details about how to install [!INCLUDE[orchlong](../../orch/deploy/includes/orchlong_md.md)] on a single server, as an individual feature, and as a highly available deployment.  
  
For information about how to install [!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage/includes/orchshort_md.md)] at the command prompt and details about the available command line arguments, see the section [Install with the Orchestrator Command Line Install Tool](../../orch/deploy/Install-with-the-Orchestrator-Command-Line-Install-Tool.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you do not want to use the **[!INCLUDE[orchlong](../../orch/deploy/includes/orchlong_md.md)] Setup Wizard** to install [!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage/includes/orchshort_md.md)] features because Server Message Block \(SMB\) is not permitted through your firewall or you have concerns about SMB security, you can manually install runbook servers and integration packs with the [!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage/includes/orchshort_md.md)] command line install tool. For more information about the tool, see the topic [Install with the Orchestrator Command Line Install Tool](../../orch/deploy/Install-with-the-Orchestrator-Command-Line-Install-Tool.md).
