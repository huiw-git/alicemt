# Move File
The Move File activity moves a file from one directory to another. You can move files to network shares that are available using UNC paths. You can also move files from a local or publicly available network folder, such as an FTP location, to an internal folder.  
  
## Configuring the Move File Activity  
Before you configure the Move File activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The files you are moving.  
  
-   The destination path where you will move the files.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Move File activity.  
  
### Details Tab  
  
|Settings|Configuration Instructions|  
|------------|------------------------------|  
|**File**|Type the path and name of the file that you want to move. You can use the \* and ? wildcards to specify the filename and path. These wildcards behave the same way as in the Windows Command Prompt.|  
|**Include sub\-folders**|Select this option to move any files within the sub\-folders of the path you have specified that match the filename that you have specified.|  
|**Folder**|Type the path of the folder where you want the files to be moved to.|  
|**If the destination exists**|Select the action that you want to take if a file with the same name already exists in the destination folder:<br /><br />**Overwrite**: Select this option to overwrite the existing file with the file that is being moved.<br /><br />**Fail**: Select this option to cause the Move File activity to fail if the filename already exists.<br /><br />**Create a file with a unique name**: Select this option to append a value to the filename to create a unique name that does not conflict with an existing name.|  
  
### Advanced Tab

|**days**|Enter the number of **days** that you will use with the **File age** measure.|
