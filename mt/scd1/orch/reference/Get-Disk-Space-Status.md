# Get Disk Space Status
The Get Disk Space Status activity will retrieve the current amount of available disk space on a UNC path or local disk drive that you specify. This activity can be used to check the space of a destination folder before transferring files to that location.  
  
## Configuring the Get Disk Space Status Activity  
Before you configure the Get Disk Space Status activity, you need to determine the UNC path or local drive that you want to check.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Get Disk Space Status activity.  
  
### Details Tab  
  
|Settings|Configuration Instructions|  
|------------|------------------------------|  
|**Computer**|Type the name of the computer that you are checking. You can also use the ellipsis **\(...\)** button to browse for the computer.|  
|**Drive**|Type the drive path you want to check. To specify a local drive path include the colon and backslash. For example, to specify the Local Disk \(C:\), type **"C:\\"**. If you specify a local drive path, the runbook server that runs the runbook will check its local drive. The runbook server that runs this runbook must have the appropriate rights to check the process on the computer on which you are checking the disk space status.|
