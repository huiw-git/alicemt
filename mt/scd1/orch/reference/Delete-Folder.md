# Delete Folder
The Delete Folder activity deletes a folder, sub\-folders, or the entire folder tree of a directory on the local file system or a network location specified using a UNC path. You can delete temporary folders that were created when a runbook runs or you can use this activity to purge data that has been recently archived.  
  
## Configuring the Delete Folder Activity  
Before you configure the Delete Folder activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The folder name you are targeting.  
  
-   Whether you are going to delete the entire tree; delete the sub\-folders only; or delete just the directory.
