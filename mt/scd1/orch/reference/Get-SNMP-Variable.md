# Get SNMP Variable
The Get SNMP Variable activity will query a network device for the value of variable that is assigned to the Management Information Base address that you specify. You can use the Get SNMP Variable activity to retrieve information about a network device to determine if an administrator needs to be notified.  
  
## Configuring the Get SNMP Variable Activity  
Before you configure the Get SNMP Variable activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The IP address of the device, as well as the port number, SNMP MIB, and SNMP version  
  
-   The community string required to retrieve the variable.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot set individual security credentials for this activity. It will run under the service account configured for the Runbook Service on the Runbook server where the instance of the activity is running. This account must have the authority to access the resources and perform the actions required by this activity.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Get SNMP Variable activity.
