# Search and Replace Text
The Search and Replace Text activity searches for and replaces text that you specify in a text file.  
  
This activity replaces functionality in the Manage Text File legacy activity from Opalis 6.3.  
  
## Configuring the Search and Replace Text Activity  
Before you configure the Search and Replace Text activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The file name you want to search in.  
  
-   The encoding that the file you want to search in uses.  
  
-   The text you want to search for.  
  
-   The replacement text  
  
Use the following information to configure the Search and Replace Text activity.
