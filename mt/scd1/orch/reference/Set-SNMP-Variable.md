# Set SNMP Variable
The Set SNMP Variable activity will modify a variable, specified by its MIB, on a network device. Use the Set SNMP Variable to update a variable that reports on the failure or success of a critical runbook.  
  
## Configuring the Set SNMP Variable Activity  
Before you configure the Set SNMP Variable activity you need to determine the following:  
  
-   IP address of the device as well as the port number, SNMP MIB, and the SNMP version  
  
-   Community string required to update the variable  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot set individual security credentials for this activity. It will run under the service account configured for the Runbook Service on the Runbook server where the instance of the activity is running. This account must have the authority to access the resources and perform the actions required by this activity.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Set SNMP Variable activity.
