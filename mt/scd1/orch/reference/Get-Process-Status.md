# Get Process Status
The Get Process Status activity checks the status of a running process on any computer. Use the Get Process Status activity to check the status of a process before performing another action. For example, you can check that a process that was detected by the [Monitor Process](../../orch/reference/Monitor-Process.md) activity is still running before shutting it down with the [End Process](../../orch/reference/End-Process.md) activity.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The Get Process Status activity returns a status of **failed** if the named process is not running. If the activity returns **failed**, the overall status of the runbook is set to **warning** or **failed**, depending on the number of activities in the runbook.
