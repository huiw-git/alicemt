# Save Event Log
The Save Event Log activity is used to save entries from an event log so that they can be used later. The Save Event Log activity saves the event log entries to a delimited text file in a format that you specify. The activity allows you to choose which fields will be saved and allows you to filter against the fields to only allow particular event log entries to be saved. This activity uses a satellite license.  
  
The Save Event Log activity can be used to create audit trails of problems that occur with a particular application or specific categories of event log entries. These saved files can later be used to track the performance of servers and applications in your network.  
  
## Configuring the Save Event Log Activity  
Before you configure the Save Event Log activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The event log that you are saving from  
  
-   The computer where it is located  
  
-   The fields that you want to include  
  
-   The format of the file  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> If you require only specific entries to be saved and not the entire event log, you will need to know what fields to filter against as well as what values to filter.
