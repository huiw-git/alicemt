# Append Line
The Append Line activity appends a line of text into a text file.  Use the Append Line activity to append lines to a log file to create audits trails of runbooks.  
  
This activity replaces functionality in the Manage Text File legacy activity from Opalis 6.3.  
  
## Configuring the Append Line Activity  
Before you configure the Append Line activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The file name you want to append to.  
  
-   The type of file encoding that the file you are appending to uses.  
  
-   Text you append.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Append Line activity.
