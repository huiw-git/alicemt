# Monitor Internet Application
The Monitor Internet Application activity will invoke a runbook when an internet application server becomes unavailable or becomes available. You can monitor a Web, Email \(POP3 or SMTP\), FTP, or DNS server.  You can also configure your external FTP or Web servers to be reachable through the internet and then automatically restart the server if it is found to be unavailable.  
  
## Configuring the Monitor Internet Application Activity  
Use the following information to configure the Monitor Internet Application activity.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot set individual security credentials for this activity. It will run under the service account configured for the Runbook Service on the Runbook server where the instance of the activity is running. This account must have the authority to access the resources and perform the actions required by this activity.
