# Read Line
The Read Line activity reads lines from a text file. You can use the Read Line activity to read lines from a text file and pass them to another activity using published data.  
  
This activity replaces functionality in the Manage Text File legacy activity from Opalis 6.3.  
  
## Configuring the Read Line Activity  
Use the following information to configure the Read Line activity.  
  
### Details Tab  
  
|Settings|Configuration Instructions|  
|------------|------------------------------|  
|**File**|Type the path and name of the file that you want to read the text from, or click the ellipsis button **\(...\)** and browse for it.|  
|**File encoding**|Click the ellipsis button **\(...\)** and select the format that the file is encoded in from the **File encoding** drop\-down list. Verify that you select the correct encoding format. If the file uses a different encoding format, the activity fails.|  
|**Line numbers**|Type the line numbers of the text that you want to read from the file that you specified.<br /><br />-   To specify a range of lines, use a hyphen: 1\-3. This reads lines 1 to 3.<br />-   To specify specific lines, use a comma: 5,7,9. This reads lines 5, 7, and 9.<br />-   Combine the range and specific lines: 1\-3,5,7,9. This reads lines 1 to 3, and lines 5, 7, and 9.<br />-   To specify from a specific line to the last line of the file, type the line number, hyphen, and END: 4\-END. This reads lines 4 to the last line of the file.<br />-   To specify from a specific line to a line relative to the last line of the file, type the line number, hyphen, the less\-than sign, and the line number relative to the end line: 4\-END<3. If the file has 20 lines, this reads lines 4 to 17 from the file. <3 represents the third line from the end.<br />-   To specify the last number of lines, type LASTLINES, colon, and the last number of lines that you want to delete: LASTLINES:10. This reads the last 10 lines of the file.<br />-   Combine different types of operations: 1\-5, 8, 10\-END<20, LASTLINES:10. This reads lines 1 to 5, line 8, line 10 to the 20th line from the end, and the last 10 lines. Do not overlap lines or line ranges when combining operations. For example, 5\-END, LASTLINES:10 fails because the 5\-END operation already reads to the end, so the LASTLINES:10 operation cannot succeed because the lines are already read, and the activity fails. **Important:** Do not specify lines numbers that do not exist in the file, and do not specify a line number more than once, or the activity will fail.|
