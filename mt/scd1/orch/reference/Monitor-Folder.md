# Monitor Folder
The Monitor Folder activity invokes a runbook when the folder that you specified has changed, or if the files within that folder have been changed. You can monitor the size of log files in a folder. If the files grow too large, the Monitor Folder activity can invoke a runbook that will archive, backup, and then purge the log files to clean up the folder.  
  
## Configuring the Monitor Folder Activity  
Before you configure the Monitor Folder activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The folder name you are monitoring.  
  
-   What condition invokes the runbooks.  
  
-   Optionally, you may need to know what file types you want to monitor.
