# Read Text Log
The Read Text Log activity will read lines in a structured text log file. If you have log files that change names, you can configure the Read Text Log activity to read from the newest file in a folder that matches a file name pattern. The Read Text Log activity can be used to check a log for errors and then take corrective action on the server that is creating the log or send an email to an administrator to escalate the issue.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> For the Read Text Log activity to work correctly, every line in the text log file must begin with a timestamp.  
  
## Configuring the Read Text Log Activity  
Before you configure the Read Text Log activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The log file name you are reading.  
  
-   The timestamps format in the log.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Read Text Log activity.  
  
### Details Tab  
  
|Settings|Configuration Instructions|  
|------------|------------------------------|  
|**File**|Select and type the name of the log file that will be read. You can also use the ellipsis **\(...\)** button to browse for the file.|  
|**The most recent file in this folder**|Select and type the folder where the most recent file that matches the pattern that you specify will be read. You can also use the ellipsis **\(...\)** button to browse for the folder.|  
|**Matching this pattern**|Type the file name pattern that will be used to find the log file that will be read. You can use the \* and ? wildcards to specify the pattern. These wildcards behave in the same way as the Windows Command Prompt.|  
|**Read**|Select and specify the dates that the lines you are reading are from:<br /><br />**lines between the dates…**: Select and specify the begin date and end date that make up the range that will be read. The dates that you specify must match the **Timestamp format**.<br /><br />**lines more recent than…**: Select and specify the oldest date of the logs that will be read. The date that you specify must match the entered **Timestamp format**.<br /><br />**new lines**: Select to read all the logs that have not previously been read by the Read Text Log activity.|  
|**Timestamp format**|Specify the format of the timestamp of the logs. For more information on how to specify the timestamp format, see the following Timestamp Format Codes table.|  
|**Read the last lines**|Enter the number of lines.|  
  
### Timestamp Format Codes
