# Check Schedule
The Check schedule activity verifies that a runbook is allowed to run at the current time according to the permitted times or interval configured in a schedule. To use this activity, you can create a schedule and configure the permitted times, denied times, or interval at which the runbook can run. Then you can insert the activity into a runbook following a [Monitor Date and Time](../../orch/reference/Monitor-Date-and-Time.md) activity and configure it to check the schedule to verify whether a runbook is allowed to run at the current time. You can also use the Check Schedule activity in a runbook that monitors systems for availability. If a problem is encountered, the Check Schedule activity can verify whether the current time is during business hours, or in or out of a maintenance window.
