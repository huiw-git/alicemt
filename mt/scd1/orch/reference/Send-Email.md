# Send Email
The Send Email activity sends an email message using the standard SMTP protocol or an Exchange server. You can use this activity to notify an administrator of problems that have occurred with a system.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you put more than 1 MB of text directly into the message body, the activity can fail during initialization. To avoid this issue, enter no more than 1 MB of text directly into the message body or save the text to a file, and provide the file name as the message you want to send.
