# Write to Database
The Write to Database activity writes a row into a database table. This activity interacts with the following databases:  
  
-   Access  
  
-   ODBC  
  
-   Oracle  
  
-   SQL Server  
  
The Write to Database activity can be used to replicate important Windows Event Log Events to a database table that is able to be queried and maintained.
