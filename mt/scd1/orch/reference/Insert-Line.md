# Insert Line
The Insert Line activity inserts lines into a text file on a line number that you specify.  
  
This activity replaces functionality in the Manage Text File legacy activity from Opalis 6.3.  
  
## Configuring the Insert Line Activity  
Before you configure the Insert Line File activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The name of the file you want to insert text into.  
  
-   The file encoding type of the file you want to insert text into.  
  
-   The line number location where you want to insert the text.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Insert Line activity.
