# Restart System
The Restart System activity will restart a computer on your network. The Restart System activity can either wait for applications to shut down gracefully or you can configure the activity to forcefully shut down any running applications. You also can send a message to notify your users of the reason for the disruption.  
  
Some applications may consume memory and hard disk space and will not relinquish them without restarting the system. The Restart System activity can be used to restart these systems during maintenance windows to maintain service during business hours.  
  
## Configuring the Restart System Activity  
Before you configure the Restart System activity, you will need to determine the following:  
  
-   The computer you want to restart.  
  
-   Whether you want to forcefully shut down any running applications.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Restart System activity.
