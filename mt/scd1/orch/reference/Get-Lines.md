# Get Lines
The Get Lines activity gets multiple lines from a text file according to criteria that you specify. You can use the Get Lines activity to get specific lines from any location in a text file.  
  
This activity replaces functionality in the Manage Text File legacy activity from Opalis 6.3.  
  
## Configuring the Get Lines Activity  
Before you configure the Get Lines activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The name of the file you want to get lines from.  
  
-   The encoding type that the file you want to get the lines from uses.  
  
-   The criteria you use to filter the lines.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Get Lines activity.  
  
### Details Tab
