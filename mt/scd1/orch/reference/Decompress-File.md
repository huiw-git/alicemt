# Decompress File
The Decompress File activity decompresses the files contained in a zip archive file. You can extract files from zip archives that are downloaded using email or FTP.  
  
## Configuring the Decompress File Activity  
Before you configure the Decompress File activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The archive file name that you want to decompress.  
  
-   The files names within the archive that you want to extract.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Decompress File activity.  
  
### Details Tab
