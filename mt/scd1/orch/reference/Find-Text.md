# Find Text
The Find Text activity finds lines in a text file. Use the Find Text activity to find according to a search string that you specify.  
  
This activity replaces functionality in the Manage Text File legacy activity from Opalis 6.3.  
  
## Configuring the Find Text Activity  
Before you configure the Find Text activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The name of the file that you want to search in.  
  
-   The encoding type of the file you want to search in uses.  
  
-   The text that you want to search for.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Find Text activity.
