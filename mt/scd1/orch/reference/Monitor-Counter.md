# Monitor Counter
The Monitor Counter activity invokes a runbook when a counter has reached a value that you specify. Each Monitor Counter activity monitors one counter.  
  
Use the Monitor Counter activity to monitor a counter that counts the number of times that a runbook has attempted to start a service. When that number reaches the number that you configure in the Monitor Counter activity, the Monitor Counter activity can invoke a [Send Email](../../orch/reference/Send-Email.md) activity to notify an administrator to investigate the problem.  
  
## Configuring the Monitor Counter Activity  
Before you configure the Monitor Counter activity, you need to determine the following:  
  
-   The **Counter** you will be monitoring.  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    > Before you can use this activity, you must configure a **Counter**.  
  
-   The value that will invoke the runbook
