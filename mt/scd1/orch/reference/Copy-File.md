# Copy File
The Copy File activity copies a file from one directory to another. You can also copy files to network shares that are available using UNC paths. Use the Copy File activity to copy important files that have been created or modified in a folder that is being monitored by the Monitor Folder activity to a backup location.  
  
## Configuring the Copy File Activity  
Before you configure the Copy File activity, you need to know which files you are copying and the destination path where you will put the copies.  
  
Use the following information to configure the Copy File activity.
