# Workflow Control
When you build runbooks in [!INCLUDE[orchlong](../../orch/deploy//orchlong_md.md)], it is important to understand the underlying logic of the workflow engine. By using this logic, you can create workflows to automate resource\-based jobs and complex data processing tasks.  
  
## Workflow Control  
The workflow control provides the following controls.  
  
-   [Starting Point](../../orch/manage/Starting-Point.md)  
  
-   [Smart Links](../../orch/manage/Smart-Links.md)  
  
-   [Embedded Loops](../../orch/manage/Embedded-Loops.md)
