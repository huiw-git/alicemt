# Runbook Designer
The **Runbook Designer** is the tool that you use to create, manage, and run runbooks in [!INCLUDE[orchlong](../../orch/deploy/includes/orchlong_md.md)]. The **Runbook Designer** is intended for users who must create or modify runbooks. Users who only have to run runbooks and view their status should use the Orchestration console which is documented in the [Using the Orchestration Console in System Center 2012 - Orchestrator](../../orch/manage/Using-the-Orchestration-Console-in-System-Center-2012---Orchestrator.md).  
  
## Runbook Designer Panes  
The Runbook Designer interface is organized into the following four panes.  
  
|Pane|Description|  
|--------|---------------|  
|**Connections**|The folder structure where you can organize workflows in the [!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage/includes/orchshort_md.md)] system and edit permissions on folders. Also provides access to **Runbook Servers** and **Global Settings**.|  
|**Runbook Designer workspace**|The workspace where you build [!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage/includes/orchshort_md.md)] runbooks. The runbooks in the folder selection in the **Connections** pane are listed as tabs across the top of the workspace. When you select a tab in a runbook, it is displayed in the Runbook Designer workspace.|  
|**Activities**|Contains all the activities available \(either standard activities or activities available from integration packs\) for use in runbooks. You drag activities from the **Activities** pane into the Design workspace, and then link them together to form runbooks.|  
|**Log**|Logs showing the activity and history for the current runbook. For more information, see [Orchestrator Logs](../../orch/manage/Orchestrator-Logs.md).|  
  
## Sorting Activities by Activity Name and Category Name
