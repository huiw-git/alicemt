# How to Test a Runbook
After you build a runbook, you can test it before it is run in production. To test, you use the **Runbook Tester** which you start in the **Runbook Designer**. The **Runbook Tester** lets you run the runbook to view the Published Data from each activity. You can run through the entire runbook, step through each activity one at a time, or set breakpoints at certain activities.  
  
### To test a runbook  
  
1.  In the **Runbook Designer**, open the runbook, and on the menu bar, click **Runbook Tester**.  
  
2.  If prompted, click **Yes** to check out the runbook.  
  
3.  To run through the runbook from beginning to end without stopping, click **Run to Breakpoint**.  
  
    If you want to step through it one activity at a time, click **Step**.  
  
4.  View the **Log** pane to see the completion status of each activity. To view the details and Published Data from an activity, select the activity, and click **Show Details**.  
  
### To set a breakpoint  
  
1.  Select the activity on which to set the breakpoint.  
  
2.  Click **Toggle Breakpoint**.  
  
3.  Click **Run to Breakpoint**.  
  
    Each activity up to the breakpoint runs. The runbook pauses before running the activity with the breakpoint.  
  
4.  To continue through to the end of the runbook, click **Run to Breakpoint** again, or to step through it one activity at a time, click **Step**.
