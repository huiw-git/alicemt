# Data Manipulation
With [!INCLUDE[orchlong](../../orch/deploy//orchlong_md.md)], you can manipulate string data from text files, returned data, or other sources, and convert it into a usable form. You can also perform simple arithmetic operations, such as calculating sums and differences, and performing division and multiplication operations. For example, you can extract text from a text file by using a **Text File Management** activity, trim leading and trailing spaces from the text, and then retrieve specific parts of the text that you can pass to other activities as returned data items.
