# How to Use the Integration Toolkit to Extend Orchestrator Capabilities
The [!INCLUDE[sc2012sp1_long](../../om/manage//sc2012sp1_long_md.md)][!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage//orchshort_md.md)] Integration Toolkit is a set of tools to help you create new integrations for [!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage//orchshort_md.md)]. Using wizard\-based applications, you can easily create new workflow activities and Integration Packs that extend the capabilities of the product. You can also create custom workflow activities using the [!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage//orchshort_md.md)] SDK and C\#, and then package them into an Integration Pack using this toolkit.Â For complete documentation for the [!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage//orchshort_md.md)] Integration Toolkit, see the [MSDN Library](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=261687).
