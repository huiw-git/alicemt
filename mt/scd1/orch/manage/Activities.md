# Activities
In [!INCLUDE[orchlong](../../orch/deploy//orchlong_md.md)], activities are the building blocks of runbooks. In general, individual activities perform three actions:  
  
-   Access Published Data  
  
-   Perform some action  
  
-   Publish new data  
  
All activities, regardless of origin or type, share common behaviors. This section describes the types of activities available in [!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage//orchshort_md.md)] and their common behaviors.
