# Using the Orchestration Console in System Center 2012 - Orchestrator
The Orchestration console is a web\-based tool with which an operator can perform the following functions in [!INCLUDE[orchlong](../../orch/deploy/includes/orchlong_md.md)]:  
  
-   View a list of runbooks and runbook servers.  
  
-   View the current running status and history of runbooks.  
  
-   View high\-level definition of runbooks.  
  
-   Start and stop runbooks.  
  
-   View events that runbook servers and the management server create.  
  
The functions that you can perform in the Orchestration console is a subset of the functions in  the Runbook Designer, but you can run the Orchestration console from any computer with a browser without requiring installation of a separate tool. It is intended for users who are required to manage the operation of runbooks but are not required to modify them. To provide users with this access, you have to give them permission to specific runbooks or folders. This process is described in [Runbook Permissions](../../orch/manage/Runbook-Permissions.md).
