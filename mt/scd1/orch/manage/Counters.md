# Counters
When building runbooks in [!INCLUDE[orchlong](../../orch/deploy/includes/orchlong_md.md)], you might find that there are values that must be incremented, such as keeping track of the number of backup attempts that a runbook made. Counters let you modify and check the status of a number that you can use to keep track of important statistics. You create a counter in the Connections pane in the Runbook Designer, and then get and modify it by using the [Get Counter Value](../../orch/reference/Get-Counter-Value.md) and [Modify Counter](../../orch/reference/Modify-Counter.md) activities. Each of these activities presents the value of the counter as [Published Data](../../orch/manage/Published-Data.md) so that it can be used by other activities and links.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The access permissions for counters can be modified, but the Runbook server does not enforce these permissions.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
> You cannot run multiple, simultaneous jobs for runbooks that contain Modify Counter activities because simultaneous jobs of the same runbook that modify \(set, reset, increment, or decrement\) a counter can cause the counter value to become unreliable. You can, however, read the value of counters in runbooks that run simultaneously.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> [!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage/includes/orchshort_md.md)] does not support moving multiple counters with multiple\-selection. To move more than one counter to another folder, you must move each counter individually.  
  
Use the following procedures to create a counter and to organize counters.  
  
#### To create a counter  
  
1.  In the **Connections** pane, double\-click the **Global Settings** folder, right\-click the **Counters** folder or a subfolder of the **Counters** folder to select **New**, and then click **Counter** to open the **New Counter** dialog box.  
  
2.  In the **Name** box, type a name for the counter.  
  
3.  In the **Description** box, type a description that explains the purpose of the counter.  
  
4.  In the **Default Value** box, type the starting value of the counter. This value is the starting value of the counter when it is created or reset.  
  
5.  To modify a counter, double\-click the counter.  
  
    To remove a counter, right\-click the counter to select **Delete**.  
  
6.  Click **Finish**.  
  
#### To organize counters  
  
1.  You can group counters in folders to organize them. To create a folder, right\-click the **Counters** folder to select **New**, and then click **Folder**.  
  
2.  To move a counter to a different folder, right\-click the counter to select **Move** to open the **Select a Folder** dialog box.  
  
3.  Select the destination folder, and then click **OK**. The counter is moved to the new folder location.
