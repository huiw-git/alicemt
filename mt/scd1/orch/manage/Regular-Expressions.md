# Regular Expressions
In [!INCLUDE[orchlong](../../orch/deploy/includes/orchlong_md.md)], regular expressions let you match a string to a pattern. The regular expression can contain a number of different elements that define the pattern. [Smart Link Properties](assetId:///334614e1-4192-46b5-868b-13d4d61b9fcb) use regular expressions to perform pattern matching.  
  
## Advanced Regular Expressions  
To build regular expressions, you must create an expression that contains the text that you are searching for and special characters that create a pattern, which describes how the text that you are searching for appears.  
  
|Character|Meaning|  
|-------------|-----------|  
|.|Matches any character except a newline.|  
|\*|Matches the preceding item 0 or more times. For example, the "a\*" pattern matches any string of a's in a row "a", "aaa", "aaaaaaaaaaaa", and an empty string "". To match any string of any character, use a dot followed by an asterisk. For example "a.\*" matches any text that begins with the letter "a" and ends with any string of characters such as "abbb", "abcdef", or "automatic restart".|  
|\+|Matches the preceding item 1 or more times. This is like \* but you must have a least 1 of the preceding item to make a match. For example, the "ab\+" pattern matches "abbbbb", "ab", but does not match "a". To contrast, the "ab\*" pattern matches "a".|  
|?|Matches the preceding item 0 or 1 time. For example, the "ab?" pattern matches "a" or "ab" but does not match "abbb".|  
|&#124;|Matches either the preceding expression or the following expression. Logical OR operator.|  
|$|Matches the expression at the end of the input or line. For example, "ab$" matches "I took a cab" or "drab" but does not match "absolutely not".|  
|^|Matches the expression at the beginning of the input or line. For example, "^ab" matches "absolutely not" or "abacuses are great\!" but does not match "I took a cab" or "drab".|  
|\\|For characters that are usually treated as special. This indicates that the next character is literal and is not to be treated as a special character. For example, "\\." means match the "." character and not just any character.|  
|\[ \]|A character set. Matches any one of the enclosed characters. You can specify a range of characters by using a hyphen. For example, \[a\-zA\-Z\] matches any letter of the alphabet.|  
|\[^ \]|An excluded character set. This is the opposite of \[\]. If any of the characters inside the brackets exist, the regular expression match fails. You can specify a range of characters by using a hyphen. For example, \[^a\-zA\-Z\] ensures that none of the letters in the alphabet are present.|  
|\( \)|A group expression. This groups an expression into an item that you can apply special characters to. For example, "a\*\(ba\)\+" matches "ba" "aba" or "ababa" but does not match "abbba" or "abaa"|  
  
### Examples  
  
|Expression|Meaning|  
|--------------|-----------|  
|\[a\-zA\-Z\]\+|The text contains only letters of the alphabet.|  
|^\\\*|The text begins with an asterisk.|  
|\(abc&#124;def\)$|The end of the text is either "abc" or "def".|  
|Ha..y|The text begins with "Ha" followed by any two characters followed by a "y".|  
|Help.\*|The text is "Help" followed by any number of other characters.|
