# How to Configure Runbook Throttling
By default, each runbook server is configured to simultaneously run a maximum of 50 runbooks. You can change this number by using the Runbook Server Runbook Throttling tool. In most cases, you can keep this default setting, but you should consider the resource requirements of the runbooks on a particular server when considering whether to change it. If the server has a number of runbooks with high resource requirements, you might run fewer runbooks simultaneously on the runbook server. If they are simple runbooks with minimal requirements, you might consider increasing the number of simultaneously run runbooks.  
  
### To configure the maximum number of runbooks that a runbook server processes  
  
1.  Navigate to the folder where by default the Runbook Server Runbook Throttling tool is stored: **<System Drive>:\\Program Files \(x86\)\\Microsoft System Center 2012\\Orchestrator\\Management Server**.  
  
2.  Type one of the following commands:  
  
    -   To apply the change to one runbook server:  
  
        **aspt <RunbookServerName> <MaximumRunningRunbooks>.**  
  
        For example, to set the maximum number of runbooks that RunbookServer1 runs to 40:  
  
        **aspt RunbookServer1 40**  
  
    -   To apply the change to all runbook servers:  
  
        **aspt \* <MaximumRunningRunbooks>.**  
  
        For example, to set the maximum number of runbooks that all runbook servers run to 40:  
  
        **aspt \* 40**  
  
3.  Restart the **[!INCLUDE[orchshort](../../om/manage/includes/orchshort_md.md)] Runbook Service**.
