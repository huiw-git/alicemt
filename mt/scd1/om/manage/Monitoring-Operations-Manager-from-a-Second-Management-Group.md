# Monitoring Operations Manager from a Second Management Group
Businesses using [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)] in multiple management groups sometimes want to monitor one management group from another management group. This topic provides some tips for monitoring one management group \(management group A\) from a second management group \(management group B\).  
  
-   You can install an agent on management servers in management group A from management group B. If you install the agent manually, configure the agent to report to a management server in management group B.  
  
-   Disable Active Directory integration for the agent you install on the management server in management group A.  
  
-   To upgrade the management server in management group A, you must remove the management group B agent first.  
  
-   After the agent is installed, ensure that you do not configure the agent to also report to management group A \(“multihome” the agent\).  
  
-   Ensure that the Run As accounts for the Default Action Account and Privileged Monitoring Account profiles for the management server in management group B are using credentials that can remotely authenticate and that have sufficient permissions on the management servers in management group A.
