# How to Create a Configuration Changes Report
[!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)] monitors parameters of objects that are defined in management packs. You can create a Configuration Changes report listing changes that have occurred to monitored parameters. You should expect a delay of at least 2 minutes from the time when a change is made until it is reflected in a Configuration Changes report. In the following example procedure, you will make a change to the Heartbeat Interval setting and then create a Configuration Changes report to view the result.
