# Monitoring Integration between Operations Manager and TFS in System Center 2012 R2
Synchronization between [!INCLUDE[omblue_2](../../om/manage/includes/omblue_2_md.md)] and Team Foundation Server \(TFS\) makes efficient communication possible between information technology \(IT\) operations and developers. A healthy TFS environment is essential for all development processes. Depending on your environment, you can import TFS monitoring and management packs that give you real\-time visibility into the health of the TFS developer environment.  
  
The TFS Work Item Synchronization management pack synchronizes [!INCLUDE[omblue_2](../../om/manage/includes/omblue_2_md.md)] alerts and TFS work items. Additionally, it monitors the synchronization infrastructure, and it generates alerts when synchronization fails. However, to monitor the complete TFS infrastructure, you need additional monitoring packs that alert you about a wide range of problems with TFS components. When you import the TFS Work Item Synchronization management pack, it is a best practice to also import and configure these monitoring packs. Together, they help you make sure that you are monitoring the complete health of the developer TFS environment.

> [!NOTE]  
> If your environment contains TFS 2010 and TFS 2012, you can use both monitoring packs together \(Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Team Foundation Server Monitoring Management Pack for Microsoft System Center and Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 Team Foundation Server Monitoring Management Pack for Microsoft System Center\). Also, you can use these management packs without enabling synchronization between [!INCLUDE[omblue_2](../../om/manage/includes/omblue_2_md.md)] alerts and TFS work items to get visibility into the health of the TFS environment.
