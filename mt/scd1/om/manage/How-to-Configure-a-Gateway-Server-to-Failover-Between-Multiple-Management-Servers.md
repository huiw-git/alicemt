# How to Configure a Gateway Server to Failover Between Multiple Management Servers
Use the Get\-ManagementServer\-GatewayManagementServer cmdlet in the Operations Manager Shell as shown in the following example to configure a gateway server to fail over to multiple management servers. The commands can be run from any command shell in the management group.  
  
### To configure gateway server failover to multiple management servers  
  
1.  Log on to the gateway server with an account that is a member of the Administrators role for the management group.  
  
2.  Click **Start**, click **All Programs**, click **Microsoft System Center 2012**, click **Operations Manager**, and then click **Operations Manager Shell**.  
  
3.  In Operations Manager Shell, run the following command:  
  
    ```  
    $primaryMS = Get-SCOMManagementServer –Name “<name of primary server>”  
    $failoverMS = Get-SCOMManagementServer –Name “<name of 1st failover>”,”<name of 2nd failover>”,…,”<name of nth failover>”  
    $gatewayMS = Get-SCOMGatewayManagementServer –Name “<name of gateway>”  
  
    Set-SCOMParentManagementServer –Gateway $gatewayMS –PrimaryServer $primaryMS  
    Set-SCOMParentManagementServer –Gateway $gatewayMS –FailoverServer $failoverMS  
  
    ```  
  
    For help with the Set\-SCOMParentManagementServer command, type the following in the command shell window.  
  
    ```  
    Get-help Set-SCOMParentManagementServer -full  
    ```
