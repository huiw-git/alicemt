# How to Suspend Monitoring Temporarily by Using Maintenance Mode
Maintenance mode, available from the **Monitoring** workspace of the Operations console in [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage/includes/om12short_md.md)], enables you to avoid any alerts or errors that might occur when a monitored object, such as a computer or distributed application, is taken offline for maintenance. Maintenance mode suspends the following features:  
  
-   Rules and monitors  
  
-   Notifications  
  
-   Automatic responses  
  
-   State changes  
  
-   New alerts  
  
Use the following procedure to place one or more monitored objects into maintenance mode.  
  
### To put a monitored object into maintenance mode  
  
1.  Log on to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Administrators role.  
  
2.  In the Operations console, click **Monitoring**.  
  
3.  In the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Monitoring**, and then click **Windows Computers**.  
  
4.  In the **Windows Computers** pane, right\-click the computer that you want to place into maintenance mode, click **Maintenance Mode**, and then click **Start Maintenance Mode**. You can use ctrl\+click or shift\+click to select multiple computers to place into maintenance mode.  
  
5.  In the **Maintenance Mode Settings** dialog box, under **Apply to**, click **Selected objects only** if only the computer is to be placed into maintenance mode; otherwise, click **Selected objects and all their contained objects**.  
  
6.  Select **Planned** if this is a planned event; otherwise, leave it cleared.  
  
7.  In the **Category** list, click the appropriate maintenance category.  
  
8.  Under **Duration**, select and enter the **Number of minutes** or select and enter the **Specific end time**, and then click **OK**. A maintenance mode icon appears in the **Computers** pane, in the **Maintenance Mode** column for the computer you selected.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > The minimum value for **Numberofminutes** is 5. The maximum value is 1,051,200 \(2 years\).  
  
### To edit maintenance mode settings for a monitored object  
  
1.  Log on to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Administrators role.  
  
2.  In the Operations console, click **Monitoring**.  
  
3.  In the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Monitoring**, and then click **Windows Computers**.  
  
4.  Right\-click the computer in the **Windows Computers** pane whose settings you want to edit, click **Maintenance Mode**, and then click **Edit Maintenance Mode settings**.  
  
5.  In the **Maintenance Mode Settings** dialog box, edit the settings you want to change, and then click **OK**.  
  
### To stop maintenance mode on a monitored object  
  
1.  Log on to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Administrators role.  
  
2.  In the Operations console, click **Monitoring**.  
  
3.  In the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Monitoring**, and then click **Windows Computers**.  
  
4.  In the **Windows Computers** pane, right\-click the computer that you want to take out of maintenance mode, click **Maintenance Mode**, and then click **Stop Maintenance Mode**.  
  
5.  In the **Maintenance Mode** dialog box, do the following:  
  
    -   If you selected **Selected objects and all their contained objects** when you placed the computer into maintenance mode, select **Remove contained objects** and then click **Yes**.  
  
    -   If you selected **Selected objects only**, clear **Remove contained objects** and then click **Yes**.  
  
6.  In the **Windows Computers** pane, the maintenance mode icon disappears from the **Maintenance Mode** column for the computer you selected.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Because [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage/includes/om12short_md.md)] polls maintenance mode settings only once everyÂ 5 minutes, there can be a delay in an object's scheduled removal from maintenance mode.
