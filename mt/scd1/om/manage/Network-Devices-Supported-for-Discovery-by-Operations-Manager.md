# Network Devices Supported for Discovery by Operations Manager
[!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)] can monitor physical network routers and switches, including the interfaces and ports on those devices, and the virtual local area networks \(VLANs\) and Hot Standby Router Protocol \(HSRP\) groups that they participate in, as well as firewalls and load balancers. Operations Manager can monitor network devices that support SNMP, and can provide port monitoring for devices that implement interface MIB \(RFC 2863\) and MIB\-II \(RFC 1213\) standards.  
  
[!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage/includes/om12short_md.md)] provides more detailed processor or memory monitoring for some network devices, which are listed in the [Network Devices with Extended Monitoring Capability spreadsheet](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=231254). The devices worksheet includes processor and memory columns for each device to indicate whether [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage/includes/om12short_md.md)] can provide extended monitoring for either or both aspects for each device.
