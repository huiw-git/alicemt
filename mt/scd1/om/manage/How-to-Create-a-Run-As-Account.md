# How to Create a Run As Account
This procedure tells you how to create a Run As Account by using a set of Windows credentials as an example. Then it shows you how to edit the properties of the Run As Account to modify the security level and distribution of the credentials.  You use this same procedure for all other account types.  
  
The credentials that you provide in a Run As Account are used to run tasks, rules, monitors and discoveries as defined by the management pack that they are in. The management pack guide has the settings that you need for configuring the Run As Account and the Run As Profile.  
  
When you create a Run As Account you are warned that you must associate the Run As Account with a Run As profile, and you are not presented with the option to configure Run As Account credential distribution. Both of these activities can be accomplished in the Run As Profile wizard. Alternately, you can configure Run As Account credential distribution by editing the properties of the Run As Account as shown next.  
  
### To create a Run As account  
  
1.  Log on to the Operations console with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Administrators role.  
  
2.  In the Operations console, click **Administration**.  
  
3.  In the **Administration** workspace, right\-click **Accounts**, and then click **Create Run As Account**.

    4.  Click **Next**.  
  
6.  On the **Credentials** page, type a user name, and its password, and then select the domain for the account that you want to make a member of this Run As account.  
  
7.  Click **Next**.  
  
8.  On the **Distribution Security** page, select the **Less secure** or **More secure** option as appropriate. For more information, see [Distribution and Targeting for Run As Accounts and Profiles](../../om/manage/Distribution-and-Targeting-for-Run-As-Accounts-and-Profiles.md).

    3.  **Show management servers**, in some cases, for example cross platform monitoring, all monitoring is performed by a management server and therefore the credentials have be distributed to the management servers that is performing the monitoring.  
  
7.  Optionally, type in a value in the **Filter by: \(Optional\)** box to narrow the search result set and click **Search**. A list of computers that match the search criteria is displayed in the **Available items** box.
