# How to Schedule the Delivery of a Report to the SQL Report Server Cache
You can create a schedule for sending reports to the cache in the SQL ServerÂ Report Server and thereby shorten the time required to retrieve a report if the report is large or accessed frequently. For more information about report caching, see [Caching Reports \(SSRS\)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=77536).  
  
The example in this procedure uses an availability report that you have already created and saved as a favorite. For more information about creating an availability report, see [How to Create an Availability Report](../../om/manage/How-to-Create-an-Availability-Report.md). For more information about saving a report as a favorite, see [How to Save a Report](../../om/manage/How-to-Save-a-Report.md).

1.  Log on to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Report Operators role.  
  
2.  In the Operations console, click **Reporting**.  
  
3.  In the **Reporting** workspace, click **Favorite Reports**.  
  
4.  In the **Favorite Reports** pane, right\-click the availability report you saved as a favorite, and then click **Schedule**.

    1.  Type a description in the **Description** text box.

    3.  Click **Next**.  
  
6.  On the **Subscription Schedule** page, do the following:  
  
    1.  Select one of the **Generate the report** options.  
  
    2.  Type a start date and start time for the reports to be generated in **The Subscription is effective beginning** list. You can also enter the date when this subscription will end in **The subscription will end** list, and then click **Next**.  
  
7.  On the **Parameters** page, specify a span of time for the report in the **From** and **To** lists, make any other changes you need for this report, and then click **Finish**.
