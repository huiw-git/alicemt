# Using the Visio 2010 Add-in and SharePoint 2010 Visio Services Data Provider
The Visio 2010 Add\-in for [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)] combines the strengths of two applications widely used in enterprise IT to simplify the creation of customized dashboards that show the health of an environment. The Visio Add\-in lets you create diagrams that show objects by geography on a map, by location in a data center or building, by role in a logical view of an application, or by topology for complex distributed applications such as Microsoft Exchange Server or technologies such as Active Directory Domain Services.  
  
The SharePoint 2010 Visio Services Data Provider for [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)] enables you to take the customized dashboards you create with the Visio 2010 Add\-in and include them in SharePoint 2010 Web sites. These Web\-based dashboards are updated and provide access to instant status information through the familiar SharePoint browser\-based experience.  
  
The Visio 2010 Add\-in and SharePoint 2010 Visio Services Data Provider have the following features:  
  
-   Distributed applications exported from [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage/includes/om12short_md.md)] as Visio documents automatically show live health state information on the exported objects when opened in Microsoft Office Visio.  
  
-   You can easily create new Visio documents and link shapes to any managed object \(such as a computer, database, Web site, or perspective\) to show the current health state.  
  
-   You can automatically link entire existing Visio documents to the computer and to network devices managed by [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage/includes/om12short_md.md)] by matching computer names or IP addresses.  
  
-   Health states can be automatically refreshed in Visio documents. You can use this option along with Visioâ€™s full\-screen view to create dashboard views suitable for use as a summary display in a data center control room.  
  
-   Predefined data graphics enable you to switch from [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage/includes/om12short_md.md)] health icons to the shape color for health state.  
  
-   Health states can be automatically refreshed in published Visio documents that are hosted in SharePoint 2010 document libraries, when the Visio Services data provider for [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)] is installed and configured on the SharePoint 2010 server farm.
