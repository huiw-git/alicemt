# Viewing Active Alerts
To view active alerts, open the Operations console and click **Monitoring**. The Monitoring Overview displays a summary of health states and alerts:  
  
![Monitoring overview summarizes alert status](../../om/manage/media/Monitor.jpg "Monitor")  
  
To view the actual alerts, click **Active Alerts** in the navigation pane.  
  
**Tip**: If you are using the web console, you can filter the view of alerts by severity:  
  
![Filter alerts by severity](../../om/manage/media/ConsoleFilter.gif "ConsoleFilter")  
  
The list of alerts in the Results pane includes the severity, source, maintenance mode status, name, resolution state, and when the alert was created:  
  
![Active Alerts](../../om/manage/media/ActiveAlerts.gif "ActiveAlerts")
