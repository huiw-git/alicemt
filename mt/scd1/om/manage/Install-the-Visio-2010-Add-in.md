# Install the Visio 2010 Add-in
The Visio 2010 Add\-in for [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)] has the following prerequisites:  
  
-   System Center 2012 â€“ Operations Manager Operations or Authoring console.  
  
    You can download the Authoring console from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=136356) \(http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkID\=136356\).  
  
-   Microsoft Office Visio 2010 Professional or Premium.  
  
-   [The Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=131605) \(http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkID\=131605\).  
  
When you run the Setup program for the Visio Add\-in, your system is checked against these requirements. If your system does not meet the requirements, a link is provided so that you can download the missing software.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> If you have previously installed the Vision 2007 version of the Add\-in on this computer, uninstall it before installing the Visio 2010 Add\-in.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> If you previously installed the Visio Add\-in with [!INCLUDE[om2007r2long](../../om/manage//om2007r2long_md.md)], and upgraded to [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)], you must uninstall it prior to installing the [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)] version.
