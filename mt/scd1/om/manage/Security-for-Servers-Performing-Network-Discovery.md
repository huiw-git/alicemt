# Security for Servers Performing Network Discovery
You must ensure the following firewall configuration for network monitoring:  
  
-   All firewalls between the management servers in the resource pool and the network devices need to allow SNMP \(UDP\) and ICMP bi\-directionally, and ports 161 and 162 need to be open bi\-directionally. This includes Windows Firewall on the management server itself.  
  
-   If your network devices are using a port other than 161 and 162, you need to open bi\-directional UDP traffic on these ports as well.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Note for customers who used EMC Solutions for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager: EMC Smarts included tools to create an isolation layer to prevent denial of service attacks. In [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)], you need to protect your network against packet storms by using external tools.
