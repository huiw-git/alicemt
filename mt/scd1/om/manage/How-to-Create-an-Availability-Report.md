# How to Create an Availability Report
The following procedure is an example of how you create an availability report for a managed computer. The procedure presented here is applicable to creating other types of availability reports. In this example procedure, you generate a report for the entire week.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Operations Manager Reporting must be installed before you can run an Availability report.  
  
The availability report provides the following information about the selected computers:  
  
-   **Down** – computer state is critical \(red\)  
  
-   **Up** – computer state is healthy \(green\)  
  
-   **Yellow** – computer state is warning \(yellow\)  
  
-   **Unmonitored** – computer or monitor did not exist during reporting period  
  
-   **Monitor disabled** – monitor has been disabled, such as by using an override  
  
-   **Monitoring unavailable** – the System Center Management Health service monitoring the computer is unavailable  
  
-   **Planned\/unplanned maintenance** – computer is in maintenance mode; overrides all other states  
  
### To create an availability report  
  
1.  Log on to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Administrators role.  
  
2.  In the Operations console, click **Monitoring**.  
  
3.  In the **Monitoring** workspace, expand **Monitoring**, and then click **Windows Computers**.  
  
4.  In the **Windows Computers** pane, click the row, or rows, that represent the computer for which you want to run an availability report.  
  
5.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Report Tasks**, click **Availability**.  
  
6.  In the **Report** view, in the **Parameter** area, click the down arrow in the **From** box, point to **This week**, and then click **Sunday**.  
  
7.  Click the down arrow in the **To** box, point to **This week** and then click **Saturday**.  
  
8.  Click **Use business hours**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > You can further specify the timeframe for the report in the additional options in the **Parameter** area.  
  
9. When you have specified the timeframe for the report, click **Run** to display the Availability Report.  
  
10. For a more detailed report, such as a report showing a graph for every day, click the horizontal bar graph under **Availability Tracker**.  
  
11. In the tool bar, click **View**, point to **Go To**, and then click **Back to Parent Report** to return to the original report.  
  
12. Click **Close** to close the report.
