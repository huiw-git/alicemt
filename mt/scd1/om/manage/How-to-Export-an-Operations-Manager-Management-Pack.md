# How to Export an Operations Manager Management Pack
Exporting a management pack allows customizations to a sealed management pack to be saved to a file. Because sealed management packs cannot be changed, the customizations made to a management pack are saved to a separate, unsealed management pack file. The unsealed management pack can then be imported to a different management group. This unsealed management pack is dependent on the original sealed management pack and can be imported only to management groups that have the original sealed management pack.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Using the Operations Console, you can only export unsealed management packs. To export a sealed management pack, you must use the Export\-SCOMManagementPack cmdlet. See [Operations Manager Cmdlet Reference \[OM2012\]](assetId:///b38f41d8-8e7c-4b56-82b1-95af6527b8a4) for more information.  
  
### To export management pack customizations  
  
1.  Log on to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Administrators role.  
  
2.  In the Operations console, click **Administration**.  
  
3.  In **Administration**, click **Management Packs** to display the list of imported management packs.  
  
4.  In the **Management Packs** pane, right\-click the management pack you want to export, and then click **Export Management Pack**.  
  
5.  In the **Browse For Folder** dialog box, expand the path for the location to save the file, and then click **OK**.  
  
    The management pack is saved as an Operations Manager XML management pack file and is ready for importing into another management group.
