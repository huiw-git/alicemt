# Change the Way Health State is Represented in Visio 2010
By default, health state is depicted by using the [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)] health icons \(such as the green check mark for a healthy state\). You can customize the way that health state is shown by changing the data graphic associated with the object. For example, you can show the health state by filling the shape with red, yellow, green, or grey color to represent the three health states and to represent a managed object in maintenance mode.  
  
### To change the way that health state is represented  
  
1.  Select the shape or shapes that you want to change.  
  
2.  On the Data tab, click **Data Graphics**.  
  
3.  In the Data Graphics window, click the data graphic that you want to use. The Visio Add\-in for [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)] includes two choices. The **SCOM IconSet** data graphic shows health state using icons as in [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage//om12short_md.md)]. The **SCOM Color by Value** data graphic uses red, yellow, green, or grey color to represent the three health states and to represent a managed object in maintenance mode.
