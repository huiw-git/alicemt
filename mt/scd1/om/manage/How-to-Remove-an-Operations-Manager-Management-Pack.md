# How to Remove an Operations Manager Management Pack
When you no longer need a management pack, you can delete it using the Operations console. When you delete a management pack, all the settings and thresholds associated with it are removed from [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)]. Also, the .mp or .xml file for that management pack is deleted from the hard disk of the management server. You can delete a management pack only if you have first deleted dependent management packs.  
  
### To remove a management pack  
  
1.  Log on to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Administrators role.  
  
2.  In the Operations console, click **Administration**.  
  
3.  In **Administration**, click **Management Packs.**  
  
4.  In the **Management Packs** pane, right\-click the management pack you would like to remove and then click **Delete**.  
  
5.  On the message stating that deleting the management pack might affect the scoping of some user roles, click **Yes**.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> If any other imported management packs depend on the management pack you are trying to remove, the **Dependent Management Packs** error message displays. You must remove the dependent management packs before you can continue.  
  
Operations Manager removes the selected management pack.
