# Assign Tasks and Views
The Create User Role Wizard contains a page that defines the tasks that the user role you are creating can perform and a page that specifies the views that the user role you are creating can open and use. The default setting is that all users assigned that user role can run all tasks and open all views as long as their profile and scope allows it. The alternative in these wizard pages is to list the specific tasks or views that the user role you are creating can access.
