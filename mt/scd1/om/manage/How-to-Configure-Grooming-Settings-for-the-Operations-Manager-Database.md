# How to Configure Grooming Settings for the Operations Manager Database
The grooming process removes unnecessary data from the Operations Manager database in order to maintain performance by managing its size. It deletes unnecessary records. You can configure the grooming setting for the following record types:  
  
-   Resolved alerts  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Active alerts are never groomed. You must close an alert before it will be groomed.  
  
-   Event data  
  
-   Performance data  
  
-   Task history  
  
-   Monitoring job data  
  
-   State change events data  
  
-   Performance signature  
  
-   Maintenance mode history  
  
-   Availability history  
  
Any updates to the grooming settings are applied immediately.  
  
Use the following procedure to specify when specific record types are deleted or groomed from the Operations Manager database of an Operations Manager management group. The default grooming setting for all record types is data older than 7 days.
