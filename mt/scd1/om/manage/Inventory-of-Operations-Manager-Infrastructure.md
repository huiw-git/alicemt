# Inventory of Operations Manager Infrastructure
Both maintaining and troubleshooting [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)] can be easier when you have a comprehensive inventory of the Operations Manager infrastructure. Ideally, the inventory is started when you first install Operations Manager, and updated as you add features and extend monitoring. If you have an existing infrastructure and no inventory, we recommend that you invest the time to document a complete inventory. [Recommendations for Daily, Weekly, and Monthly Operations Manager Tasks](../../om/manage/Recommendations-for-Daily--Weekly--and-Monthly-Operations-Manager-Tasks.md) includes a monthly task to review and update the inventory.
