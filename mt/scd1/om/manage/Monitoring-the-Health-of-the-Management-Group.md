# Monitoring the Health of the Management Group
[!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)] introduces a new dashboard view that provides a comprehensive picture of the health of your management group. The dashboard tries to answer the question, “do I need to do anything?”  
  
The **Management Group Health** view allows you to see at a glance the health state of all management group functions, such as resource pools, and the management group infrastructure, such as management servers. It also shows you recent agent health state including gray agents, agent configuration for agents pending management, and agent versions.  
  
You can display **Management Group Health** on a SharePoint site by using the Operations Manager Web Part, giving all authorized users a useful summary of management group status. For more information, see [Using SharePoint to View Operations Manager Data](../../om/manage/Using-SharePoint-to-View-Operations-Manager-Data.md).  
  
**Management Group Health** automatically refreshes every 15 minutes by default. To manually refresh the view, right\-click the view and click **Refresh**. It may take some time before the dashboard starts to show data. The agent data is recalculated every 15 minutes, and not when you refresh the dashboard.  
  
This topic describes the specific information you will see in each cell of the **Management Group Health** dashboard view.
