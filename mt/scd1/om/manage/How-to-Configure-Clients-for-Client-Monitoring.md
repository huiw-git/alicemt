# How to Configure Clients for Client Monitoring
This topic provides the procedure to configure clients for the Client Monitoring feature of [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)].  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must first configure a management server for the server component of Client Monitoring by running the Client Monitoring Configuration Wizard. For more information, see [How to Configure a Management Server for Client Monitoring](../../om/manage/How-to-Configure-a-Management-Server-for-Client-Monitoring.md).  
  
### To configure clients for Client Monitoring in Operations Manager  
  
1.  Run the Group Policy Object Editor \(gpedit.msc\) for the domain or local computer.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > For information about Group Policy, see [http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/?LinkId\=156845](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=156845).  
  
2.  If needed, disable the **Turn off Windows Error Reporting** policy. This policy can be found in Computer Configuration\/Administrative Templates\/System\/Internet Communication Management\/Internet Communication settings.  
  
3.  Add the Agentless Exception Monitoring \(AEM\) Group Policy administrative template \(*ServerName*.ADM\) to the domain or local computer policy. The ADM file is created when the Client Monitoring Configuration Wizard is run.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    > Use the same procedure to **Disable** the Group Policy settings, thereby disabling Client Monitoring on the clients.
