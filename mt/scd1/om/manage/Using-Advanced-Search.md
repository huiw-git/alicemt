# Using Advanced Search
In [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)], advanced search is available in My Workspace, when you create a new search. You can also open advanced search in the Monitoring workspace on the **Tools** menu.  
  
Use advanced search to search for a specific object type that meets specified criteria. Advanced search has two steps:  
  
-   [Select the specific object type and criteria](../../om/manage/Using-Advanced-Search.md#BKMK_Selectthespecificobjecttype)  
  
-   [Set the criteria values](../../om/manage/Using-Advanced-Search.md#BKMK_Setthecriteriaandvalues)  
  
You can also save the searches you create. For more information, see [Running and saving searches](../../om/manage/Using-Advanced-Search.md#bkmk_runningandsavingsearches).  
  
## <a name="BKMK_Selectthespecificobjecttype"></a>Select the Specific Object Type and Criteria  
Each object type will display a unique set of criteria for your search. The following table lists the object types and the criteria available for each.  
  
|Object type|Criteria associated with the object type|  
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|  
|Alerts|-   Of a specific severity<br />-   Of a specific priority<br />-   Created by specific sources<br />-   With specific resolution state<br />-   With a specific name<br />-   With specific text in the description<br />-   Created in specific time period<br />-   Assigned to a specific owner<br />-   Raised by an instance with a specific name<br />-   Last modified by a specific user<br />-   That was modified in specific time period<br />-   Had its resolution state changed in a specific time period<br />-   That was resolved in a specific time period<br />-   Resolved by specific user<br />-   With a specific ticket ID<br />-   Was added to the database in a specific time period<br />-   For a specific site<br />-   With specific text in the available custom fields|  
|Events|-   Generated by specific rules<br />-   With a specific event number<br />-   From a specific source<br />-   Generated in specific time period<br />-   Raised by an instance with a specific name<br />-   With specific severity level<br />-   From a specific user<br />-   Logged by a specific computer|

|Monitors|-   With a specific name<br />-   With specific text in the description<br />-   The monitor has been overridden for any context \(excluding category overrides\)<br />-   With specific category<br />-   Creates an alert when specific state is detected<br />-   The monitor generates alerts of specific priority<br />-   Auto\-resolves alerts<br />-   The monitor is a unit monitor<br />-   The monitor is an aggregate monitor<br />-   The monitor is a dependency monitor|  
|Object Discoveries|-   With a specific name<br />-   With specific text in the description<br />-   The object discovery has been overridden for any context \(excluding category overrides\)<br />-   With specific category<br />-   Is enabled<br />-   The object discovery confirms delivery<br />-   The rule is remotable <sup>1</sup><br />-   Was added in a specified time period<br />-   Was modified in a specified time period|  
|Rules|-   With a specific name<br />-   With specific text in the description<br />-   The rule has been overridden for any context \(excluding category overrides\)<br />-   With specific category<br />-   The rule generates alerts of specific priority<br />-   Is enabled<br />-   The rule confirms delivery<br />-   The rule is remotable <sup>1</sup><br />-   Was added in a specified time period<br />-   Was modified in a specified time period|  
|Tasks|-   With a specific name<br />-   With specific text in the description<br />-   Is enabled<br />-   Was added in a specified time period<br />-   Was modified in a specified time period|  
|Views|-   With a specific name<br />-   With specific text in the description<br />-   Was added in a specified time period<br />-   Was modified in a specified time period|  
  
<sup>1</sup> A remotable rule or discovery can run against a computer that does not have an agent installed.  
  
## <a name="BKMK_Setthecriteriaandvalues"></a>Set the Criteria Values  
If you have ever created a rule in Microsoft Outlook, setting criteria values for an advanced search will be familiar to you. When you select a criterion for an object, it is added to the **Criteria description** section. Most criteria contain a variable value. For example, in the criterion **With a specific name**, *specific* is a variable and will be underlined in the **Criteria description** section. \(The criterion **Is enabled** is only true or false, so it contains no variables; you either select it or you do not select it.\)  
  
To assign a value to the variable, click the underlined portion of the criterion. A dialog box appears. In the example of **With a specific name**, you enter a text string for the specific name. For variables with limited values, such as alert priorities, the dialog box provides checkboxes that you can select.  
  
## <a name="bkmk_runningandsavingsearches"></a>Running and Saving Searches  
After you set the values for the search criteria, you can run the search by clicking **Search** or you can save the search by clicking **Save parameters to My Favorites**. Saved searches are displayed in My Workspace and can be run at any time.  
  
When you run a search or a saved search, a window opens with a view appropriate to the object type of your search. For example, a search on object type **Alerts** opens an Alert View window. A hyperlinked action, **Show parameters**, is displayed below the view title bar. You can click **Show parameters** to change the search parameters.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> When you run a saved search, change the parameters, click **Search**, and then close the results window, you will be asked if you want to save the changes to the search.
