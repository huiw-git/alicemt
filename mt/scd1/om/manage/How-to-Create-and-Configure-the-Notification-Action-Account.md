# How to Create and Configure the Notification Action Account
In [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)], when an alert is generated, Operations Manager can notify designated individuals by email, instant message \(IM\), or text message \(SMS\). The Notification Account Run As profile is used to send notifications.
