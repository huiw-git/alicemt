# How to Set Credentials for Accessing UNIX and Linux Computers
This topic contains procedures for how to set credentials in wizards for the following tasks, as set by wizards in [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage//om12long_md.md)]:  
  
-   [Credentials for Installing Agents](../../om/manage/How-to-Set-Credentials-for-Accessing-UNIX-and-Linux-Computers.md#BKMK_Installing)  
  
-   [Credentials for Run As Accounts](../../om/manage/How-to-Set-Credentials-for-Accessing-UNIX-and-Linux-Computers.md#BKMK_RunAs)  
  
-   [Credentials for Upgrading an Agent](../../om/manage/How-to-Set-Credentials-for-Accessing-UNIX-and-Linux-Computers.md#BKMK_Upgrade)  
  
-   [Credentials for Uninstalling an Agent](../../om/manage/How-to-Set-Credentials-for-Accessing-UNIX-and-Linux-Computers.md#BKMK_Uninstall)  
  
These wizards define credentials to be authenticated on the UNIX or Linux computer and follow a similar process. For an overview of how credentials are provided, see [Accessing UNIX and Linux Computers in Operations Manager](../../om/manage/Accessing-UNIX-and-Linux-Computers-in-Operations-Manager.md).  
  
## <a name="BKMK_Discovering"></a>Credentials for Discovering UNIX and Linux Computers  
The following procedure begins in **Computer and Device Management Wizard**, on the **Discovery Criteria** page, when you click the **Set Credentials** button. For more information, see [Install Agent on UNIX and Linux Using the Discovery Wizard](../Topic/Install%20Agent%20on%20UNIX%20and%20Linux%20Using%20the%20Discovery%20Wizard.md).
