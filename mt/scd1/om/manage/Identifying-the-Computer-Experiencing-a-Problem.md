# Identifying the Computer Experiencing a Problem
This topic helps you answer questions such as “I see an alert that says logical disk defragmentation is high. Where is it high?”  
  
### To identify the computer experiencing a problem  
  
1.  Click the alert.  
  
    ![Select alert in Results pane](../../om/manage/media/HowToAlert1.gif "HowToAlert1")  
  
2.  Look in the **Details** section for the **Path**.  
  
    ![See Path in alert details](../../om/manage/media/HowToAlert2.gif "HowToAlert2")  
  
    Notice that this alert also includes the affected computer in the **Description**.  
  
3.  Click **Windows Computers** to view the state of the computer.  
  
    ![Windows Computers monitoring view](../../om/manage/media/HowToAlert3.gif "HowToAlert3")  
  
4.  Right\-click the computer, point to **Open**, and click **Health Explorer**:  
  
    ![Open Health Explorer](../../om/manage/media/HowToAlert4.gif "HowToAlert4")  
  
In this illustration, you see that the logical disk fragmentation levels for C: and D: on this computer are in a warning state. Notice that the state rolls up to the **Performance** state for each disk, then to **Hardware Performance** for the computer, then to **Performance** for the computer, and finally to **Entity Health** for the computer.
