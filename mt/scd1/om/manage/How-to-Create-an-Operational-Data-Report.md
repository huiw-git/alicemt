# How to Create an Operational Data Report
The Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program \(CEIP\) collects information about how you use Microsoft programs and about some of the issues you might encounter. Microsoft uses this information to improve the products and features you use most often and to help solve issues. Participation in the program is strictly voluntary.  
  
During setup of Operations Manager Reporting, on the **Operational Data Reports** page, you had the option to join CEIP. If you elected to join CEIP, Operations Manager Reporting collects information about your installation and sends reports to Microsoft on a weekly basis. You can view the contents of these Operational Data Reports by creating a Microsoft ODR Report.  
  
### To create a Microsoft ODR Report  
  
1.  Log on to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Report Operators role.  
  
2.  In the Operations console, click **Reporting**.  
  
3.  In the **Reporting** workspace, expand **Reporting**, and then click **Microsoft ODR Report Library**.  
  
4.  In the **Reports** pane, right\-click one of the reports \(for example, **Management Packs**\), and then click **Open**.  
  
5.  In the **Report** view, in the **Parameter** area, click the down arrow in the **From** box, point to **This week**, and then click **Sunday**.  
  
6.  Click the down arrow in the **To** box, point to **This week**, and then click **Saturday**.  
  
7.  Click **Run** to display the ODR Report.  
  
8.  Click **Close** to close the report.
