# How to Set Alert Resolution States
In [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)], there are two default resolution states for alerts: **New** and **Closed**.  
  
When an alert is generated, its resolution state is **New**. Operators can change the resolution state for a new alert to Closed or to a custom resolution state that an administrator has created for the management group.  
  
Custom alert resolution states can used any descriptor you want, such as “Assigned to support” or “Requires investigation”. The default resolution states cannot be changed or deleted.  
  
Each resolution state is assigned an ID, a number which uniquely identifies that resolution state. The ID for **New** is 0 and the ID for **Closed** is 255. You can assign custom resolution states any value between 1 and 254.  
  
### To set the resolution state for an alert  
  
1.  In the Operations console, click **Monitoring**.  
  
2.  Click any view that displays alerts, such as **Active Alerts**.  
  
3.  Right\-click an alert, point to **Set Resolution State**, and then click the desired resolution state.  
  
### To create an alert resolution state  
  
1.  In the Operations console, click **Administration**.  
  
2.  Click **Settings**.  
  
3.  Double\-click **Alerts**.  
  
4.  On the **Alert Resolution States** tab, click **New**.  
  
5.  In **Add Alert Resolution State**, type a name for the resolution state and select a value in the **Unique ID** box, and then click **OK**.  
  
6.  In **Global Management Group Settings – Alerts**, click **OK**.
