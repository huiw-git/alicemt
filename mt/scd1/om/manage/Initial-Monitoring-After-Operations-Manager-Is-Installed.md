# Initial Monitoring After Operations Manager Is Installed
When Operations Manager, a component of System Center 2012, is first installed, only the features of the Operations Manager infrastructure such as management servers, reporting servers, and databases are monitored. Monitoring of the infrastructure is provided by the Monitoring Pack for Operations Manager, one of the management packs that is installed with Operations Manager. You can view details for the Monitoring Pack for Operations Manager in its guide at [http:\/\/go.microsoft.com\/fwlink\/p\/?LinkId\=226940](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=226940).  
  
After Operations Manager is installed, you must decide which objects—computers and devices—should be monitored, and which applications, features, and services should be monitored on those objects.

-   [Managing Discovery and Agents](../Topic/Managing%20Discovery%20and%20Agents.md)  
  
    This section provides the information you need for discovering objects and configuring the objects to be monitoed by Operations Manager.  
  
-   [Using Management Packs](../../om/manage/Using-Management-Packs.md)  
  
    Monitoring for applications, features, and services is enabled by importing management packs. This section explains what management packs do, and how to import and manage them.  
  
-   [Tuning Monitoring by Using Targeting and Overrides](../../om/manage/Tuning-Monitoring-by-Using-Targeting-and-Overrides.md)  
  
    The monitoring provided by management packs creates a useful starting point, however most businesses will want to tailor the monitoring to meet their needs. This section explains how to tune monitoring by using overrides and how to use classes and groups as override targets.  
  
> [!TIP]  
> As you install agents and import management packs, you should document your actions. For more information, see [Inventory of Operations Manager Infrastructure](../../om/manage/Inventory-of-Operations-Manager-Infrastructure.md).
