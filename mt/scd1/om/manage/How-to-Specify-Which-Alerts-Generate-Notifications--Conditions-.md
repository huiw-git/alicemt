# How to Specify Which Alerts Generate Notifications (Conditions)
When you create a subscription to be notified of Operations Manager alerts, you must specify the criteria or conditions that determine the alerts that will generate a notification. The following illustration shows the conditions you can choose from.  
  
![List of conditions for alerts](../../om/manage/media/OM12_AlertConditions.gif "OM12_AlertConditions")  
  
When you select a condition, it is added to the **Criteria description**. In the **Criteria description** box, the word **specific** is blue and underlined, and is a placeholder for the value for the condition. Click **specific** to set the value for that condition.  
  
For example, for the condition of **a specific severity**, click **specific**, and then select from the available values: **Information**, **Warning**, and **Critical**.  
  
When you create a notification subscription from an alert that has been generated, the conditions for the subscription are configured automatically with values from the specific alert.
