# How to Export a Report
After a report has been created, you can export the report into one of several formats.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Operations ManagerÂ Reporting must be installed before you can run a report.  
  
If you want to manage and distribute reports securely, you can export reports to Microsoft Windows SharePoint Services, which offers digital rights management. Consult your network security administrator.  
  
### To export a report  
  
1.  After a report has been run, in the toolbar, click the **File** menu, point to **Export**, and then click the format you want to export the file to.  
  
2.  In the **Save As** dialog box, select the folder where you want to save the report, and then click **Save**.
