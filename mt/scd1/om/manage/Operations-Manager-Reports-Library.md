# Operations Manager Reports Library
[!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)] provides the reports described in the following tables. For more information on a report, in the **Reporting** workspace, click the report and view the **Report Details**. For information on reports that are provided by other management packs, see the respective management pack guides.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> When you first install Operations Manager, it may take several minutes for all report libraries to appear in **Reporting**.
