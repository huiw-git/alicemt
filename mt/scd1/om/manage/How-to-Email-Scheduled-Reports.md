# How to Email Scheduled Reports
Before you can schedule a report for email delivery, you must configure the email settings in the Report Server using the Reporting Server Configuration Manager.  
  
The example in this procedure uses an availability report that you have already created and saved as a favorite. For more information about creating an availability report, see [How to Create an Availability Report](../../om/manage/How-to-Create-an-Availability-Report.md). For more information about saving a report as a favorite, see [How to Save a Report](../../om/manage/How-to-Save-a-Report.md).
