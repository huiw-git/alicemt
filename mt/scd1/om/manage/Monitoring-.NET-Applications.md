# Monitoring .NET Applications
In [!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)], you can monitor web applications from server\- and client\-side perspectives to get details about application performance and reliability that can help you pinpoint the root causes of incidents. When you specify settings, the types of events to collect, the performance goals to measure, and servers to monitor, [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage/includes/om12short_md.md)] application monitoring reveals how web\-based applications are running. You can see how frequently a problem is occurring, how a server was performing when a problem occurred, and the chain of events related to the slow request or method that is unreliable. This information is required to partner with software developers and database administrators to help ensure that applications perform correctly and reliably at optimal levels.  
  
## A New 2\-Step Application Monitoring Strategy  
Application monitoring in [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage/includes/om12short_md.md)] has two new monitoring features that allow you to prioritize alerts and then investigate and troubleshoot individual issues:  
  
-   **Step 1: Identify problem areas** Use Application Advisor to help you prioritize and manage which performance and exception events to address. Application Advisor identifies and lists which applications are causing the most problems within an environment. These are the applications you should address first because they are causing most SLA violations. If you are responsible for applications, Application Advisor provides a helpful view into your applicationâ€™s overall health.  
  
-   **Step 2: Diagnose problems** Use Application Diagnostics to help you investigate and troubleshoot specific events. You can view event properties, performance counters, distributed chains, similar and related events to narrow the cause of the issue and help identify who should correct the problem. Application Diagnostics is available as a standalone web console or through links in the Alert descriptions in the [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../om/manage/includes/om12short_md.md)] consoles.
