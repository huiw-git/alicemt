# How to Configure a Proxy for Agentless Monitoring
[!INCLUDE[om12long](../../om/manage/includes/om12long_md.md)] can monitor Microsoft Windows\-based computers on which an agent is not installed by using an agent on another computer to act as a proxy. This is called agentless management.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Not all management packs support agentless management, so make sure agentless management will serve your needs before using it. For example, the Active Directory and Microsoft Exchange ServerÂ 2003 management packs do not support agentless management.  
  
When you set up agentless monitoring of a computer, you select a proxy for each agentless\-managed computer. Being configured as a proxy agent allows an agent to submit data on behalf of another source. A management group can serve as a proxy, but this takes up system resources. A best practice is using an agent\-managed computer as a proxy agent.  
  
You might also configure a computer to act as a proxy to support specific features of a management pack. For example, the Active Directory Management Pack requires enabling domain controllers to act as proxy agents.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> If a proxy agent is removed from management, its agentless systems are no longer managed.  
  
Both the agentless\-managed system and its proxy need to have access to the managing server through any firewalls. For more information about interacting with firewalls, see \(link to appropriate content in deployment\).  
  
### To configure an agent\-managed computer as a proxy for agentless\-managed computers  
  
1.  In the **Administration** workspace, click **Agent Managed**, right\-click the computer, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the **Agent Properties** dialog box, click the **Security** tab.  
  
3.  On the **Security** tab, select **Allow this agent to act as a proxy and discover managed objects on other computers**, and then click **OK**.  
  
### How to configure a management server as a proxy for agentless\-managed computers  
  
1.  In the **Administration** workspace, click **Management Servers**, right\-click the management server, and then click **Properties**.  
  
2.  In the **Management Server Properties** dialog box, click the **Security** tab.  
  
3.  On the **Security** tab, select **Allow this server to act as a proxy and discover managed objects on other computers,** and then click **OK**.  
  
### To change the proxy agent for agentless\-managed computers  
  
1.  Log on to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Administrators role for the management group.  
  
2.  In the Operations console, click **Administration**.  
  
3.  Click **Agentless Managed**.  
  
4.  In the **Agentless Managed** pane, select the agentless\-managed computers for which you want to change the proxy agent, right\-click them, and then select **Change Proxy Agent**.  
  
5.  In the **Change Proxy Agent** dialog box, select the computer you want to be the new proxy agent, and then click **OK**.
