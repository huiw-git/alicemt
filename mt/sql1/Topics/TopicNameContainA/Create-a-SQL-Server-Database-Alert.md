# Create a SQL Server Database Alert
  You can use System Monitor to create an alert that is raised when a threshold value for a System Monitor counter has been reached. In response to the alert, System Monitor launches an application, such as a custom application written to handle the alert condition. For example, you could create an alert that is raised when the number of deadlocks exceeds a specific value.  
  
 Alerts also can be defined by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent. For more information, see [Alerts](../Topic/Alerts.md).  
  
 For more information about using System Monitor to set up a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] database alert, see [Set Up a SQL Server Database Alert &#40;Windows&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameContainA/Set-Up-a-SQL-Server-Database-Alert--Windows-.md) .
