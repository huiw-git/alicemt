# Log Shipping Tables and Stored Procedures
  This topic describes all of the tables and stored procedures associated with a log shipping configuration. All log shipping tables are stored in **msdb** on each server. The tables below describe which tables and stored procedures are used on which servers in a log shipping configuration.

## Secondary Server Tables  
  
|Table|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[log_shipping_monitor_alert](../Topic/log_shipping_monitor_alert%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)|Stores alert job ID. This table is only used on the secondary server if a remote monitor server has not been configured.|  
|[log_shipping_monitor_error_detail](../Topic/log_shipping_monitor_error_detail%20\(Transact-SQL\).md)|Stores error detail for log shipping jobs associated with this secondary server.|
