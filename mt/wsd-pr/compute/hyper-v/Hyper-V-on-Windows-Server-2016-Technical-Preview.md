# Hyper-V on Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview
**This is preliminary content and subject to change.**  
  
The Hyper\-V server role in Windows Server lets you create a virtualized server computing environment where you can create and manage virtual machines. You can run multiple operating systems on one physical computer and isolate the operating systems from each other. With this technology, you can improve the efficiency of your computing resources and free up your hardware resources.  
  
See the topics in the following table to learn more about Hyper\-V on [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../../compute/hyper-v/includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)].
