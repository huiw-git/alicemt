# AD DS Troubleshooting
This guide provides troubleshooting information for Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) in the [!INCLUDE[firstref_longhorn](../../identity/ad-ds/includes/firstref_longhorn_md.md)] operating system. It is designed to help you identify and resolve problems that may be related to AD DS. Conditions for domain controllers that are running versions of Windows Server 2003 in a [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../identity/ad-ds/includes/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] forest are also discussed.  
  
 This release of this guide includes troubleshooting recommendations and procedures for diagnosing and fixing problems that may occur with Active Directory replication in a [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../identity/ad-ds/includes/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] forest. This content focuses primarily on responses to Directory Service event log messages and tool\-based error messages that might be reported by the Repadmin.exe and Dcdiag.exe tools. These tools are available on all domain controllers that are running [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../identity/ad-ds/includes/nextref_longhorn_md.md)]. You can also install Remote Server Administration Tools \(RSAT\) on a member server that is running [!INCLUDE[nextref_longhorn](../../identity/ad-ds/includes/nextref_longhorn_md.md)] or on a computer that is running Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 \(SP1\). For information about installing RSAT, see [Configuring a Computer for Troubleshooting](../../identity/ad-ds/Configuring-a-Computer-for-Troubleshooting.md).
