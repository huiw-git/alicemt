# Server to Server Storage Replication
You will configure these computers and storage in a server\-to\-server configuration, where one node replicates its own set of storage with another node and its set of storage. These nodes and their storage should be located in separate physical sites, although it is not required.  
  
There are no graphical tools in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../compute/hyper-v/includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] that can configure Storage Replica for standalone replication.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT] In this test, one node will need to be in a physical or logical site, and the other node in a different physical or logical site. Each server must be able to communicate with the other via a network.  
  
### Terms  
This walkthrough uses the following environment as an example:  
  
-   Two servers, named **SR\-SRV05** and **SR\-SRV06**.  
  
-   A pair of logical “sites” that represent two different data centers, with one called **Redmond** and one called **Bellevue**.  
  
![Server to Server Storage Replication](../storage/media/Storage_SR_ServertoServer.png "Storage_SR_ServertoServer")  
  
**FIGURE: Server to Server Replication**  
  
### Prerequisites  
  
* Active Directory Domain Services forest (does not need to run Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview).  
* Two servers with Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview installed.  
* Two sets of storage, using SAS JBODs, fibre channel SAN, iSCSI target, or local SCSI/SATA storage. The storage should contain a mix of HDD and SSD media. You will make each storage set available only to each of the servers, with no shared access.  
* Each set of storage must allow creation of at least two virtual disks, one for replicated data and one for logs. The physical storage must have the same sector sizes on all the data disks. The physical storage must have the same sector sizes on all the log disks.  
* At least one 1GbE connection on each server for synchronous replication, but preferably RDMA.   
* Appropriate firewall and router rules to allow ICMP, SMB (port 445, plus 5445 for SMB Direct) and WS-MAN (port 5985) bi-directional traffic between all nodes.  
* A network between servers with enough bandwidth to contain your IO write workload and an average of ≤5ms round trip latency, for synchronous replication. Asynchronous replication does not have a latency recommendation.  
 * The replicated storage cannot be located on the drive containing the Windows operating system folder.
  
Many of these requirements can be determined by using the `Test-SRTopology cmdlet`. You get access to this tool if you install Storage Replica or the Storage Replica Management Tools features on at least one server. There is no need to configure Storage Replica to use this tool, only to install the cmdlet. More information is included in the steps below.  
  
### Provision operating system, features, roles, storage, and network  
  
> [!WARNING] [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../compute/hyper-v/includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] does not support Storage Replica on production servers.  
  
1.  Install [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../compute/hyper-v/includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] on both server nodes with an installation type of Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview 5 \(Desktop Experience\). Do not choose Standard Edition if it is available, as it does not contain Storage Replica.  
  
2.  Add network information and join them to the domain, then restart them.  
  
    > [!NOTE] From this point on, always logon as a domain user who is a member of the built-in administrator group on all servers. Always remember to elevate your PowerShell and CMD prompts going forward when running on a graphical server installation or on a Windows 10 computer.  
  
3.  Connect first set of JBOD storage enclosure, iSCSI target, FC SAN, or local fixed disk \(DAS\) storage to the server in site **Redmond**.  
  
4.  Connect second set of storage to the server in site **Bellevue**.  
  
5.  As appropriate, install latest vendor storage and enclosure firmware and drivers, latest vendor HBA drivers, latest vendor BIOS\/UEFI firmware, latest vendor network drivers, and latest motherboard chipset drivers on both nodes. Restart nodes as needed.  
  
    > [!NOTE] Consult your hardware vendor documentation for configuring shared storage and networking hardware.  
  
6.  Ensure that BIOS\/UEFI settings for servers enable high performance, such as disabling C\-State, setting QPI speed, enabling NUMA, and setting highest memory frequency. Ensure power management in Windows Server is set to high performance. Restart as required.  
  
7.  Configure roles as follows:  
  
    -   **Graphical method**  
  
        1.  Run **ServerManager.exe** and create a Server Group, adding all server nodes.  
  
        2.  Install the **File Server** and **Storage Replica** roles and features on each of the nodes and restart them.  
  
    -   **Windows PowerShell method**  
  
        On SR\-SRV06 or a remote management computer, run the following command in a Windows PowerShell console to install the required features and roles and restart them:  
  
        ```  
        $Servers = 'SR-SRV05','SR-SRV06'  
  
        $Servers | ForEach { Install-WindowsFeature –ComputerName $_ –Name Storage-Replica,FS-FileServer –IncludeManagementTools -restart }  
        ```  
  
        For more information on these steps, see [Install or Uninstall Roles, Role Services, or Features](http://technet.microsoft.co/library/hh831809.aspx)  
  
8.  Configure storage as follows:  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    > -   You must create two volumes on each enclosure: one for data and one for logs.  
    > -   Log and data disks must be initialized as GPT, not MBR.  
    > -   The two data volumes must be of identical size.  
    > -   The two log volumes should be of identical size.  
    > -   All replicated data disks must have the same sector sizes.  
    > -   All log disks must have the same sector sizes.  
    > -   The log volumes should use flash\-based storage, such as SSD.  
    > -   The data disks can use HDD, SSD, or a tiered combination and can use either mirrored or parity spaces or RAID 1 or 10, or RAID 5 or RAID 50.  
    > -   The data volume should be no larger than 10TB \(for a first test, we recommend no more than 1TB, in order to lower initial replication sync times\).  
    > -   The log volume must be at least 8GB and may need to be larger based on log requirements.  
    > -   The File Server role is only necessary for Test-SRTopology to operate, as it opens the necessary firewall ports for testing.  
    -   **For JBOD enclosures:**  
  
        1.  Ensure that each server can see that site’s storage enclosures only and that the SAS connections are correctly configured.  
  
        2.  Provision the storage using Storage Spaces by following **Steps 1\-3** provided in the [Deploy Storage Spaces on a Stand-Alone Server](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj822938.aspx) using Windows PowerShell or Server Manager.  
  
    -   **For iSCSI storage:**  
  
        1.  Ensure that each server can see that site’s storage enclosures only. You should use more than one single network adapter if using iSCSI.  
  
        2.  Provision the storage using your vendor documentation. If using Windows\-based iSCSI Targeting, consult [iSCSI Target Block Storage, How To](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh848268.aspx).  
  
    -   **For FC SAN storage:**  
  
        1.  Ensure that each set server can see that site’s storage enclosures only and that you have properly zoned the hosts.  
  
        2.  Provision the storage using your vendor documentation.  
  
    -   For local fixed disk \(DAS\) storage:  
  
        -   Ensure the storage does not contain a system volume, page file, or dump files.  
  
        -   Provision the storage using your vendor documentation.  
  
9. Start Windows PowerShell and use the **Test\-SRTopology** cmdlet to determine if you meet all the Storage Replica requirements. You can use the cmdlet in a requirements-only mode for a quick test as well as a long running performance evaluation mode.  
  
    For example, to validate the proposed nodes that each have a **F:** and **G:** volume and run the test for 30 minutes:  
  
        MD c:\temp  
           
        Test-SRTopology -SourceComputerName SR-SRV05 -SourceVolumeName f: -SourceLogVolumeName g: -DestinationComputerName SR-SRV06 -DestinationVolumeName f: -DestinationLogVolumeName g: -DurationInMinutes 30 -ResultPath c:\temp  
          
  
  
  
      > [!IMPORTANT]When using a test server with no write IO load on the specified source volume during the evaluation period, consider adding a workload or it will not generate a useful report. You should test with production\-like workloads in order to see real numbers and recommended log sizes. Alternatively, simply copy some files into the source volume during the test or download and run  [DISKSPD](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/DiskSpd-a-robust-storage-6cd2f223) to generate write IOs. For instance, a sample with a low write IO workload for five minutes to the D: volume:  
        >   
        > Diskspd.exe \-c1g –d300 \-W5 \-C5 \-b8k \-t2 \-o2 \-r –w5 –h d:\\test.  
  
10. Examine the **TestSrTopologyReport.html** report to ensure that you meet the Storage Replica requirements.  
  
    ![SRTestSRTopologyReport](../storage/media/SRTestSRTopologyReport.png "SRTestSRTopologyReport")  
  
### Configure Server to Server Replication using Windows PowerShell  
Now you will configure server\-to\-server replication using Windows PowerShell. You must perform all of the steps below on the nodes directly or from a remote management computer that contains the  [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../compute/hyper-v/includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] RSAT management tools.  
  
1. Ensure you are using an elevated Powershell console as an administrator.  
2. Configure the server\-to\-server replication, specifying the source and destination disks, the source and destination logs, the source and destination nodes, and the log size.  
  
    ```  
    New-SRPartnership -SourceComputerName sr-srv05 -SourceRGName rg01 -SourceVolumeName f: -SourceLogVolumeName g: -DestinationComputerName sr-srv06 -DestinationRGName rg02 -DestinationVolumeName f: -DestinationLogVolumeName g:  
    ```  
  
    ![Storage_SR_PS_NewSRPartnership](../storage/media/Storage_SR_PS_NewSRPartnership.png "Storage_SR_PS_NewSRPartnership")  
  
    > [!IMPORTANT]The default log size is 8GB. Depending on the results of the `Test-SRTopology` cmdlet, you may decide to use –LogSizeInBytes with a  higher or lower value.  
  
2.  To get replication source and destination state, use `Get-SRGroup` and `Get-SRPartnership` as follows:  
  
    ```  
    Get-SRGroup  
    Get-SRPartnership  
    (Get-SRGroup).replicas  
    ```  
  
    ![Storage_SR_PS_GetSRGroup](../storage/media/Storage_SR_PS_GetSRGroup.png "Storage_SR_PS_GetSRGroup")  
  
3.  Determine the replication progress as follows:  
  
    1.  On the source server, run the following command and examine events 5015, 5002, 5004, 1237, 5001, and 2200:  
  
        ```  
        Get-WinEvent -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-StorageReplica –max 20  
        ```  
  
    2.  On the destination server, run the following command to see the Storage Replica events that show creation of the partnership. This event states the number of copied bytes and the time taken. Example:  
  
        ```  
        Get-WinEvent -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-StorageReplica | Where-Object {$_.ID -eq "1215"} | fl  
              
        TimeCreated  : 4/8/2016 4:12:37 PM  
        ProviderName : Microsoft-Windows-StorageReplica  
        Id           : 1215  
        Message      : Block copy completed for replica.  
  
                ReplicationGroupName: rg02  
                ReplicationGroupId: {616F1E00-5A68-4447-830F-B0B0EFBD359C}  
                ReplicaName: f:\  
                ReplicaId: {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}  
                End LSN in bitmap:   
                LogGeneration: {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}  
                LogFileId: 0  
                CLSFLsn: 0xFFFFFFFF  
                Number of Bytes Recovered: 68583161856  
                Elapsed Time (ms): 117  
        ```  
  
        > [!NOTE] Storage Replica dismounts the destination volumes and their drive letters or mount points. This is by design.  
  
    3.  Alternatively, the destination server group for the replica states the number of byte remaining to copy at all times, and can be queried through PowerShell. For example:  
  
        ```  
        (Get-SRGroup).Replicas | Select-Object numofbytesremaining  
        ```  
  
        As a progress sample \(that will not terminate\):  
  
        ```  
        while($true) {  
  
         $v = (Get-SRGroup -Name "RG02").replicas | Select-Object numofbytesremaining  
         [System.Console]::Write("Number of bytes remaining: {0}`r", $v.numofbytesremaining)  
         Start-Sleep -s 5  
        }  
        ```  
  
    4.  On the destination server, run the following command and examine events 5009, 1237, 5001, 5015, 5005, and 2200 to understand the processing progress. There should be no warnings of errors in this sequence. There will be many 1237 events; these indicate progress.  
  
        ```  
        Get-WinEvent -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-StorageReplica | FL  
        ```  
  
### Manage replication  
Now you will manage and operate your server\-to\-server replicated infrastructure. You can perform all of the steps below on the nodes directly or from a remote management computer that contains the [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../compute/hyper-v/includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] RSAT management tools.  
  
1.  Use `Get-SRPartnership` and `Get-SRGroup` to determine the current source and destination of replication and their status.  
  
2.  To measure replication performance, use the `Get-Counter` cmdlet on both the source and destination nodes. The counter names are:  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Partition I\/O Statistics\(\*\)\\Number of times flush paused  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Partition I\/O Statistics\(\*\)\\Number of pending flush I\/O  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Partition I\/O Statistics\(\*\)\\Number of requests for last log write  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Partition I\/O Statistics\(\*\)\\Avg. Flush Queue Length  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Partition I\/O Statistics\(\*\)\\Current Flush Queue Length  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Partition I\/O Statistics\(\*\)\\Number of Application Write Requests  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Partition I\/O Statistics\(\*\)\\Avg. Number of requests per log write  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Partition I\/O Statistics\(\*\)\\Avg. App Write Latency  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Partition I\/O Statistics\(\*\)\\Avg. App Read Latency  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Target RPO  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Current RPO  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Avg. Log Queue Length  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Current Log Queue Length  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Total Bytes Received  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Total Bytes Sent  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Avg. Network Send Latency  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Replication State  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Avg. Message Round Trip Latency  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Last Recovery Elapsed Time  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Number of Flushed Recovery Transactions  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Number of Recovery Transactions  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Number of Flushed Replication Transactions  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Number of Replication Transactions  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Max Log Sequence Number  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Number of Messages Received  
  
    -   \\Storage Replica Statistics\(\*\)\\Number of Messages Sent  
  
    For more information on performance counters in Windows PowerShell, see [Get-Counter](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh849685.aspx).  
  
3.  To move the replication direction from one site, use the `Set-SRPartnership` cmdlet.  
  
    ```  
    Set-SRPartnership -NewSourceComputerName sr-srv06 -SourceRGName rg02 -DestinationComputerName sr-srv05 -DestinationRGName rg01  
    ```  
  
    > [!WARNING]  
    > [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../compute/hyper-v/includes/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] does not prevent role switching when the initial sync is ongoing, which can lead to data loss if you attempt to switch before allowing initial replication to complete. Do not switch directions until the initial sync is complete.  
  
    Check the event logs to see the direction of replication change and recovery mode occur, and then reconcile. Write IOs can then write to the storage owned by the new source server. Changing the replication direction will block write IOs on the previous source computer.  
  
4.  To remove replication, use `Get-SRGroup`, `Get-SRPartnership`, `Remove-SRGroup`, and `Remove-SRPartnership` on each node. Ensure you run the `Remove-SRPartnership` cmdlet on the current source of replication only, not on the destination server. Run `Remove-Group` on both servers. For example, to remove all replication from two servers:  
  
    ```  
    Get-SRPartnership  
    Get-SRPartnership | Remove-SRPartnership  
    Get-SRGroup | Remove-SRGroup  
    ```  
### Replacing DFS Replication with Storage Replica  
Many Microsoft customers deploy DFS Replication as a disaster recovery solution for unstructured user data like home folders and departmental shares. DFSR has shipped in Windows Server 2003 R2 and all later operating systems and operates on low bandwidth networks, which makes it attractive for high latency and low change environments with many nodes. However, DFSR has notable limitations as a DR solution:  
* It does not replicate in-use or open files.  
* It does not replicate synchronously.  
* Its asynchronous replication latency can be many minutes, hours, or even days.  
* It relies on a database that can require lengthy consistency checks after a power interruption.  
* It is generally configured as multi-master, which allows changes to flow in both directions, possibly overwriting newer data.  
  
Storage Replica has none of these limitations. It does, however, have several that might make it less interesting in some environments:  
  
* It only allows one-to-one replication between volumes in Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview. It is possible to replicate different volumes between multiple servers.  
* While it supports asynchronous replication, it is not designed for low bandwidth, high latency networks.  
* It does not allow user access to the protected data on the destination while replication is ongoing  
  
If these are not blocking factors, Storage Replica allows you to replace DFSR servers with this newer technology.   
The process is, at a high level:  
  
1.	Install Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview on two servers and configure your storage. This could mean upgrading an existing set of servers or cleanly installing.  
2.	Ensure that any data you want to replicate exists on one or more data volumes and not on the C: drive.   
a.	You can also seed the data on the other server to save time, using a backup or file copies, as well as use thin provisioned storage. Making the metadata-like security match perfectly is unnecessary, unlike DFSR.  
3.	Share the data on your source server and make it accessible through a DFS Namespace. This is important, to ensure that users can still access it if the server name changes to one in a disaster site.  
a.	You can create matching shares on the destination server, which will be unavailable during normal operations,   
b.	Do not add the destination server to the DFSN namespace, or if you do, ensure that all its folder targets are disabled.  
4.	Enable Storage Replica replication and complete initial sync. Replication can be either synchronous or asynchronous.   
a.	However, synchronous is recommended in order to guarantee IO data consistency on the destination server.   
b.	We strongly recommend enabling Volume Shadow Copies and periodically taking snapshots with VSSADMIN or your other tools of choice. This will guarantee applications flush their data files to disk consistently. In the event of a disaster, you can recover files from snapshots on the destination server that might have been partially replicated asynchronously. Snapshots replicate along with files.  
5.	Operate normally until there is a disaster.  
6.	Switch the destination server to be the new source, which surfaces its replicated volumes to users.  
7.	If using synchronous replication, no data restore will be necessary unless the user was using an application that was writing data without transaction protection (this is irrespective of replication) during loss of the source server. If using asynchronous replication, the need for a VSS snapshot mount is higher but consider using VSS in all circumstances for application consistent snapshots.  
8.	Add the server and its shares as a DFS Namespace folder target.   
9.	Users can then access their data.  
  
 >[!NOTE] Disaster Recovery planning is a complex subject and requires great attention to detail. Creation of runbooks and the performance of annual live failover drills is highly recommended. When an actual disaster strikes, chaos will rule and experienced personnel may be permanently unavailable.
