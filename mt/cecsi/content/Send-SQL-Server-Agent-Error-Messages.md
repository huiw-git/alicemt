### <a name="Restrictions"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   Object Explorer only displays the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent node if you have permission to use it.  
  
-   The [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Windows Messenger service must be running to receive net send events.  
  
### <a name="Security"></a>Security  
  
#### <a name="Permissions"></a>Permissions  
To perform its functions, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent must be configured to use the credentials of an account that is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].

-   Log on as a service (SeServiceLogonRight)  
  
-   Replace a process\-level token (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege)  
  
-   Bypass traverse checking (SeChangeNotifyPrivilege)
