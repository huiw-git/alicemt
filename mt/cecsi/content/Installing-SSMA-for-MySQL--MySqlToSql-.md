# Installing SSMA for MySQL (MySqlToSql)
SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for MySQL consists of a client application that you use to perform a migration from MySQL to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] or SQL Azure. It also contains an extension pack that supports data migration and the use of MySQL system functions in your migrated databases.  
  
Install the client application on the computer from which you will perform the migration steps. You must install the extension pack files on the computer where the migrated databases will be hosted.  That computer must be running SQL Server.  
  
## Upgrading SSMA for MySQL  
If you want to upgrade to a later version of SSMA for MySQL, you must first uninstall the client and the server extension pack, and then install the newer version.
