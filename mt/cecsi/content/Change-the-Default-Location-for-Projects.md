# Change the Default Location for Projects
The default location for files and projects is the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../content/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] Projects folder in your My Documents folder.  
  
### To change the default location for projects  
  
1.  Change the default location by opening or saving a file or project from another location. [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../content/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] stores the location of the previously opened project and uses it for the next opening or saving of a project.
