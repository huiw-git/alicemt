# Write Execution Trace Messages to the SQL Server Agent Error Log (SQL Server Management Studio)
This topic describes how to configure [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent to include execution trace messages in its error log in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../content/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../content/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)].

-   To write execution trace messages to the SQL Server Agent Error Log using SQL Server Management Studio  
  
## <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a>Before You Begin  
  
### <a name="Restrictions"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   Object Explorer only displays the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent node if you have permission to use it.  
  
-   Because this option can cause the error log to become large, only include execution trace messages in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent error logs when investigating a specific [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent problem.  
  
### <a name="Security"></a>Security  
  
#### <a name="Permissions"></a>Permissions  
To perform its functions, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent must be configured to use the credentials of an account that is a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. The account must have the following Windows permissions:  
  
-   Log on as a service (SeServiceLogonRight)  
  
-   Replace a process\-level token (SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege)  
  
-   Bypass traverse checking (SeChangeNotifyPrivilege)  
  
-   Adjust memory quotas for a process (SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege)  
  
For more information about the Windows permissions required for the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent service account, see [Select an Account for the SQL Server Agent Service](../content/Select-an-Account-for-the-SQL-Server-Agent-Service.md) and [Setting Up Windows Service Accounts](assetId:///309b9dac-0b3a-4617-85ef-c4519ce9d014).
