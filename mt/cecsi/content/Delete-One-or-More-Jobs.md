3.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, confirm that the job you intend to delete is selected.  
  
4.  Click **OK**.  
  
#### To delete multiple jobs  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../content/includes/ssDEnoversion_md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**.  
  
3.  Right\-click **Job Activity Monitor**, and click **View Job Activity**.

## <a name="SMO"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To delete multiple jobs**  
  
Use the **JobCollection** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C\#, or PowerShell. For more information, see [SQL Server Management Objects (SMO)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms162169.aspx).
