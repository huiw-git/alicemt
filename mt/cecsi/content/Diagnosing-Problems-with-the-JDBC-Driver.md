# Diagnosing Problems with the JDBC Driver
  No matter how well an application is designed and developed, problems will inevitably occur. When they do, it is important to have some techniques for diagnosing those problems. When using the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../content/includes/jdbcNoVersion_md.md)], some common problems that can occur are not having the right driver version or being unable to connect to a database.  
  
 The topics in this section discuss a number of techniques for diagnosing these and other problems including error handling, checking the driver version, tracing, and troubleshooting connectivity issues.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Handling Errors](../content/Handling-Errors.md)|Describes how to handle errors that are returned from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)].|  
|[Getting the Driver Version](../content/Getting-the-Driver-Version.md)|Describes how to determine which version of the JDBC driver is installed.|  
|[Tracing Driver Operation](../content/Tracing-Driver-Operation.md)|Describes how to enable tracing when using the JDBC driver.|  
|[Troubleshooting Connectivity](../content/Troubleshooting-Connectivity.md)|Describes how to troubleshoot database connectivity.|  
|[Accessing Diagnostic Information in the Extended Events Log](../content/Accessing-Diagnostic-Information-in-the-Extended-Events-Log.md)|Describes how to use information in the server's extended events log to understand connection failures.|
