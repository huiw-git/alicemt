# Connection String Keywords and Data Source Names (DSNs)
This topic discusses how you can create a connection to a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] database.  
  
## Connection Properties  
For this release of the [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] ODBC Driver for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] on Linux, you can use the following connection keywords:  
  
||||||  
|-|-|-|-|-|  
|Addr|Address|ApplicationIntent|AutoTranslate|Database|  
|Driver|DSN|Encrypt|FileDSN|MARS\_Connection|  
|MultiSubnetFailover|PWD|Server|Trusted\_Connection|TrustServerCertificate|  
|UID|WSID||||  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When connecting to a database that uses database mirroring \(has a failover partner\), do not specify the database name in the connection string. Instead, send a **use***database\_name* command to connect to the database before executing your queries.  
  
For more information about these keywords, see the ODBC section of [Using Connection String Keywords with SQL Server Native Client](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=126696).  
  
The value passed to the **Driver** keyword can either be:  
  
-   The name you used when you installed the driver. Or,  
  
-   The path to the driver, which was specified in the template .ini file used to install the driver.  
  
To create a DSN, create \(if necessary\) and edit the file **~\/.odbc.ini** \(odbc.ini in your home directory\). The following is a sample file that shows the required entries for a DSN:  
  
```  
[MSSQLTest]  
Driver = ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server  
Server = [protocol:]server[,port]  
#   
# Note:  
# Port is not a valid keyword in the ~/.odbc.ini file  
# for the Microsoft ODBC driver on Linux  
#  
```  
  
You can optionally specify the protocol and port to connect to the server. For example, **Server \= tcp:***servername***,12345**.  
  
To connect to a named instance on a static port, use **Server \=** *servername***,***port\_number*. Connecting to dynamic port is not supported.  
  
Optionally, you can add the DSN information to a template file and execute the following command: **odbcinst \-i \-s \-f** *template\_file*  
  
You can verify that your driver is working by using isql to test the connection. Or, you can use this command: **bcp master.INFORMATION\_SCHEMA.TABLES out OutFile.dat \-S <server> \-U <name> \-P <password>**  
  
## Using Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\)  
You can use Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\) to encrypt connections to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)]. SSL protects [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] user names and passwords over the network. SSL also verifies the identity of the server to protect against man\-in\-the\-middle \(MITM\) attacks.  
  
Enabling encryption increases security at the expense of performance.  
  
For more information, see [Encrypting Connections to SQL Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=220900).  
  
Regardless of the settings for **Encrypt** and **TrustServerCertificate**, the server login credentials \(user name and password\) are always encrypted. The following table shows the effect of the **Encrypt** and **TrustServerCertificate** settings.  
  
||**TrustServerCertificate\=false**|**TrustServerCertificate\=true**|  
|-|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|  
|**Encrypt\=no**|Server certificate is not checked.<br /><br />Data sent between client and server is not encrypted.|Server certificate is not checked.<br /><br />Data sent between client and server is not encrypted.|  
|**Encrypt\=yes**|Server certificate is checked.<br /><br />Data sent between client and server is encrypted.<br /><br />The name \(or IP address\) in a Subject Common Name \(CN\) or Subject Alternative Name \(SAN\) in a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] SSL certificate should exactly match the server name \(or IP address\) specified in the connection string.|Server certificate is not checked.<br /><br />Data sent between client and server is encrypted.|  
  
By default, encrypted connections always verify the serverâ€™s certificate. However, if you connect to a server that has a self\-signed certificate, also add the TrustServerCertificateOption:  
  
```  
Driver='ODBC Driver 11 for SQL Server';Server=ServerNameHere;Encrypt=YES;TrustServerCertificate=YES  
```  
  
SSL uses the OpenSSL library. The following table shows the minimum supported versions of OpenSSL and the default Certificate Trust Store locations for each platform:  
  
|Platform|Minimum OpenSSL Version|Default Certificate Trust Store Location|  
|------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|  
|Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5|0.9.8e|\/etc\/pki\/tls\/cert.pem|  
|Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6|1.0.0\-10|\/etc\/pki\/tls\/cert.pem|  
|SuSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack 2|0.9.8j|\/etc\/ssl\/certs|  
  
You can use **SQLDriverConnect** to specify encryption in the connection string.
