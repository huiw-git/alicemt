# Give Others Ownership of a Job
This topic describes how to reassign ownership of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent jobs to another user.  
  
-   **Before you begin:**  [Limitations and Restrictions](#Restrictions), [Security](#Security)  
  
-   **To give others ownership of a job, using:**  
  
    [SQL Server Management Studio](#SSMSProc2)  
  
    [Transact-SQL](#TsqlProc2)  
  
    [SQL Server Management Objects](#SMOProc2)  
  
## <a name="BeforeYouBegin"></a>Before You Begin  
  
### <a name="Restrictions"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
To create a job, a user must be a member of one of the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent fixed database roles or the **sysadmin** fixed server role. A job can be edited only by its owner or members of the **sysadmin** role. For more information about the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent fixed database roles, see [SQL Server Agent Fixed Database Roles](../content/SQL-Server-Agent-Fixed-Database-Roles.md).  
  
You must be a system administrator to change the owner of a job.  
  
Assigning a job to another login does not guarantee that the new owner has sufficient permission to run the job successfully.  
  
### <a name="Security"></a>Security  
For security reasons, only the job owner or a member of the **sysadmin** role can change the definition of the job. Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can assign job ownership to other users, and they can run any job, regardless of the job owner.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> If you change job ownership to a user who is not a member of the **sysadmin** fixed server role, and the job is executing job steps that require proxy accounts (for example, [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../content/includes/ssIS_md.md)] package execution), make sure that the user has access to that proxy account or else the job will fail.  
  
#### <a name="Permissions"></a>Permissions  
For detailed information, see [Implement SQL Server Agent Security](../content/Implement-SQL-Server-Agent-Security.md).  
  
## <a name="SSMSProc2"></a>Using SQL Server Management Studio  
**To give others ownership of a job**  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer,** connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDEnoversion](../content/includes/ssDEnoversion_md.md)], and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  Expand **SQL Server Agent**, expand **Jobs**, right\-click the job, and then click **Properties**.  
  
3.  In the **Owner** list, select a login. You must be a system administrator to change the owner of a job.  
  
    Assigning a job to another login does not guarantee that the new owner has sufficient permission to run the job successfully.  
  
## <a name="TsqlProc2"></a>Using Transact\-SQL  
**To give others ownership of a job**  
  
1.  In Object Explorer, connect to an instance of the Database Engine, and then expand that instance.  
  
2.  On the toolbar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  In the query window, enter the following statements that use the [sp_manage_jobs_by_login (Transact-SQL)](assetId:///832ec15a-6e92-4eb5-8c4a-af4dba79fbaa) system stored procedure. The following example reassigns all jobs from `danw` to `françoisa`.  
  
    ```  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
  
    EXEC dbo.sp_manage_jobs_by_login  
        @action = N'REASSIGN',  
        @current_owner_login_name = N'danw',  
        @new_owner_login_name = N'françoisa' ;  
    GO  
    ```  
  
## <a name="SMOProc2"></a>Using SQL Server Management Objects  
**To give others ownership of a job**  
  
1.  Call the **Job** class by using a programming language that you choose, such as Visual Basic, Visual C\#, or PowerShell. For example code, see [Scheduling Automatic Administrative Tasks in SQL Server Agent](assetId:///900242ad-d6a2-48e9-8a1b-f0eea4413c16).
