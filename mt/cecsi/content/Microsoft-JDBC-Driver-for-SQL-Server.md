# Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server
  In our continued commitment to interoperability, Microsoft provides a Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver for use with SQL Server, and Azure SQL Database. The driver is available at no additional charge and provides Java database connectivity from any Java application, application server, or Java-enabled applet. This driver is a Type 4 JDBC driver that provides database connectivity through the standard JDBC application program interfaces (APIs).  
The Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server has been tested against major application servers such as IBM WebSphere, and SAP NetWeaver.
