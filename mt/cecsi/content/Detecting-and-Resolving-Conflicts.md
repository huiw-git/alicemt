  <introduction>
    <para>If you are dealing with your Recordset in immediate mode, there is much less chance for concurrency problems to occur. On the other hand, if your application uses batch mode updating, there may be a good chance that one user will change a record before changes that were made by another user editing the same record are saved. In such a case, you will want your application to gracefully handle the conflict. It may be your wish that the last person to send an update to the server "wins." Or you may want to let the most recent user to decide which update should take precedence by providing him with a choice between the two conflicting values.</para>
    <para>Whatever the case, ADO provides the UnderlyingValue and OriginalValue properties of the Field object to handle these types of conflicts. Use these properties in combination with the Resync method and Filter property of the Recordset.</para>
  </introduction>
  <section>
    <title>Remarks</title>
    <content>
      <para>When ADO encounters a conflict during a batch update, a warning will be added to the Errors collection. Therefore, you should always check for errors immediately after you call BatchUpdate, and if you find them, begin testing the assumption that you have encountered a conflict. The first step is to set the Filter property on the Recordset equal to adFilterConflictingRecords. This limits the view on your Recordset to only those records that are in conflict. If the RecordCount property is equal to zero after this step, you know the error was raised by something other than a conflict.</para>
      <para>When you call BatchUpdate, ADO and the provider are generating SQL statements to perform updates on the data source. Remember that certain data sources have limitations on which types of columns can be used in a WHERE clause.</para>
      <para>Next, call the Resync method on the Recordset with the AffectRecords argument set equal to adAffectGroup and the ResyncValues argument set equal to adResyncUnderlyingValues. The Resync method updates the data in the current Recordset object from the underlying database. By using adAffectGroup, you are ensuring that only the records visible with the current filter setting, that is, only the conflicting records, are resynchronized with the database. This could make a significant performance difference if you are dealing with a large Recordset. By setting the ResyncValues argument to adResyncUnderlyingValues when calling Resync, you ensure that the UnderlyingValue property will contain the (conflicting) value from the database, that the Value property will maintain the value entered by the user, and that the OriginalValue property will hold the original value for the field (the value it had before the last successful UpdateBatch call was made). You can then use these values to resolve the conflict programmatically or require the user to select the value that will be used.</para>
      <para>This technique is shown in the following code example. The example artificially creates a conflict by using a separate Recordset to change a value in the underlying table before UpdateBatch is called.</para>
