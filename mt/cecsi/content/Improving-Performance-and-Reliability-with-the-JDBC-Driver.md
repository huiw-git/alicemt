# Improving Performance and Reliability with the JDBC Driver
  One aspect of application development that is common to all applications is the constant need to improve performance and reliability. There are a number of techniques for doing this with the [!INCLUDE[jdbcNoVersion](../content/includes/jdbcNoVersion_md.md)].  
  
 The topics in this section describe various techniques for improving application performance and reliability when using the JDBC driver.  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Closing Objects when Not In Use](../content/Closing-Objects-when-Not-In-Use.md)|Describes the importance of closing JDBC driver objects when they are no longer needed.|  
|[Managing Transaction Size](../content/Managing-Transaction-Size.md)|Describes techniques for improving transaction performance.|  
|[Working with Statements and Result Sets](../content/Working-with-Statements-and-Result-Sets.md)|Describes techniques for improving performance when using the Statement or ResultSet objects.|  
|[Using Adaptive Buffering](../content/Using-Adaptive-Buffering.md)|Describes an adaptive buffering feature, which is designed to retrieve any kind of large-value data without the overhead of server cursors.|  
|[Sparse Columns](../content/Sparse-Columns.md)|Discusses the JDBC driver's support for [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] sparse columns.|
