# Working with SSMA for Access Console (AccessToSQL)
Microsoft SQL Server Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Access is now accessible through a console application at command line. The script files form the input to the application for executing the commands. As a console application, SSMA enables script-level interfacing, reduces the migration cycle, and scales the migration effort.  
  
This section explains the procedure to migrate the Access database using the SSMA Console application.
