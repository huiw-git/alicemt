# Solutions (SQL Server Management Studio)
A [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../content/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] solution is a collection of one or more related projects. Projects are containers that developers use to organize related files, such as sets of commonly used administration scripts.  
  
## Solution Overview  
You can use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../content/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] as a script development platform for [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../content/includes/ssDE_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../content/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)]. Use the [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../content/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] code editors to develop scripts and queries for relational and multidimensional databases, and collect related scripts and queries together in projects.  
  
Projects can contain:  
  
-   Queries and scripts that implement production processes.  
  
-   Connection information and files used by the queries and scripts.  
  
One or more related projects can be combined in a solution. Solutions and projects can be managed by using the Solution Explorer pane in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../content/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)].  
  
Solutions and projects can be integrated into a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] Visual SourceSafe (VSS) database or other third-party source control providers, for development change tracking and life-cycle management.
