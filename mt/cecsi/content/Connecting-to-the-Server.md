# Connecting to the Server
The topics in this section describe the options and procedures for connecting to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] with the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../content/includes/ssDriverPHP_md.md)].  
  
The [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../content/includes/ssDriverPHP_md.md)] can connect to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] by using Windows Authentication or by using SQL Server Authentication. By default, the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../content/includes/ssDriverPHP_md.md)] try to connect to the server by using Windows Authentication.
