# Installing SSMA  for Sybase (SybaseToSQL)
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Sybase consists of a client application that you use to perform a migration from Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] or SQL Azure. It also contains an extension pack that supports data migration and the use of ASE system functions in your migrated databases.  
  
You install the client application on the computer from which you will perform the migration steps. You must install the extension pack files on the computer that is running [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] where migrated databases will be hosted.  
  
## Upgrading SSMA for Sybase  
If you want to upgrade to a later version of SSMA for Sybase, you must first uninstall the client and the server extension pack, and then install the newer version.  
  
If you open a project from an earlier version of SSMA for Sybase, SSMA will ask if you want to convert the project to the newer version. You must click **Yes** to work with the project in the newer version of SSMA.
