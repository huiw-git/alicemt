# SQL Server Migration Assistant for Sybase (SybaseToSQL)
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) is a tool for migrating ASE databases to [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] 2005 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] 2008 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] 2012 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] 2014 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] 2016 or [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] SQL Azure. SSMA for Sybase converts ASE database objects to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] database objects, creates those objects in [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] or SQL Azure, and then migrates data from ASE to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] or SQL Azure.  
  
This documentation introduces you to SSMA for Sybase, provides step-by-step instructions for migrating ASE databases to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] or SQL Azure, and provides information about issues that might occur after migration. To learn more, see the following topics.
