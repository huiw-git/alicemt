# Assign a Job to a Job Category
This topic describes how to assign [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent jobs to job categories in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../content/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../content/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../content/includes/tsql_md.md)] or SQL Server Management Objects.  
  
Job categories help you organize your jobs for easy filtering and grouping. For example, you can organize all your database backup jobs in the Database Maintenance category. You can assign jobs to built\-in job categories, or you can create a user\-defined job category and then assign jobs to that.
