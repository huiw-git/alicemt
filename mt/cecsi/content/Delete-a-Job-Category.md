# Delete a Job Category
This topic describes how to delete a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent job category in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../content/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../content/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[tsql](../content/includes/tsql_md.md)] or SQL Server Management Objects.  
  
Job categories help you organize your jobs for easy filtering and grouping. For example, you can organize all your database backup jobs in the Database Maintenance category.
