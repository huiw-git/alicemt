# Working with SSMA for MySQL Console (MySQLToSQL)
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Migration Assistant (SSMA) for MySQL is now accessible through a console application at command line. The script files form the input to the application for executing the commands. As a console application, SSMA enables script-level interfacing, reduces the migration cycle, and scales the migration effort.  
  
This section explains the procedure to migrate the MySQL database using the SSMA Console application.
