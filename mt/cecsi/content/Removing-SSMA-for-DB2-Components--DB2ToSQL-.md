# Removing SSMA for DB2 Components (DB2ToSQL)
When you have finished migrating databases from DB2 to [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)], you might want to uninstall SSMA components. You can uninstall the client components at any time. However, you should not uninstall the extension pack from [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] unless your migrated databases no longer use functions in the **ssma\_DB2** schema of the **sysdb** database.  
  
## Uninstalling the SSMA for DB2 Client  
You can uninstall SSMA by using **Add or Remove Programs**.  
  
**To uninstall SSMA**  
  
1.  In Control Panel, open **Add or Remove Programs**.  
  
2.  Select **[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)][!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Migration Assistant for DB2**, and then click **Remove**.  
  
3.  To confirm that you want to uninstall SSMA, click **Yes**.  
  
## Uninstalling the Extension Pack
