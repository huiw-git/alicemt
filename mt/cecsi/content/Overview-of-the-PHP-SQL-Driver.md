# Overview of the PHP SQL Driver
The [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../content/includes/ssDriverPHP_md.md)] is a PHP 5 extension that provides data access to SQL Server 2005 and later versions including SQL Azure. The extension provides a procedural interface \(the SQLSRV driver\) and an object\-oriented interface \(the PDO\_SQLSRV driver\) for accessing data in all versions \(including Express\) beginning with SQL Server 2005 \(support for PHP for SQL Server versions 3.2 and 3.1 begins with SQL Server 2008\). The [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../content/includes/ssDriverPHP_md.md)] API includes support for Windows Authentication, transactions, parameter binding, streaming, metadata access, and error handling.  
  
To use the [!INCLUDE[ssDriverPHP](../content/includes/ssDriverPHP_md.md)] versions 2.0 and 3.0, you must have SQL Server Native Client installed on the same computer PHP is running. For versions 3.2 and 3.1, you must have the Microsoft ODBC Driver 11 \(or higher\) for SQL Server Client installed on the same computer PHP is running. For more information, see [System Requirements for the PHP SQL Driver](../content/System-Requirements-for-the-PHP-SQL-Driver.md).
