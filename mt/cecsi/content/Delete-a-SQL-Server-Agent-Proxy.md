This topic describes how to delete a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent proxy account in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../content/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../content/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tsql](../content/includes/tsql_md.md)].

### <a name="Restrictions"></a>Limitations and Restrictions  
  
-   When you delete a [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent proxy account, make sure the proxy does not reference any active job steps. To check for any job steps that reference the proxy, right\-click the proxy, select **Properties**, and then, in the *proxy\_name***Proxy Account Properties** dialog box, select the **References** page. If you delete a proxy, you are given the option to reassign all job steps that use that proxy in the **Delete Object** dialog box.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent proxies use credentials to store information about Windows user accounts. The user specified in the credential must have "Log on as a batch job" permission on the computer on which [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is running.  
  
-   [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent checks subsystem access for a proxy and gives access to the proxy each time the job step runs. If the proxy no longer has access to the subsystem, the job step fails. Otherwise, [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] Agent impersonates the user that is specified in the proxy and runs the job step.  
  
-   If the login for the user has access to the proxy, or the user belongs to any role with access to the proxy, the user can use the proxy in a job step.

#### To delete a SQL Server Agent proxy account  
  
1.  In **Object Explorer**, click the plus sign to expand a server that contains the proxy account that you want to delete.  
  
2.  Click the plus sign to expand **SQL Server Agent**.

4.  Click the plus sign to expand the subsystem that contains the proxy account you want to delete (for example, **ActiveX Script)**.  
  
5.  Right\-click the proxy account that you want to delete and select **Delete**.  
  
6.  In the **Delete Object** dialog box, confirm that the correct proxy account is selected. Check the **Reassign to** check box to reassign the job steps that reference this proxy account to another account.  
  
7.  Click **OK**.  
  
## <a name="TsqlProcedure"></a>Using Transact\-SQL  
  
#### To delete a SQL Server Agent proxy account

2.  On the Standard bar, click **New Query**.  
  
3.  Copy and paste the following example into the query window and clickÂ **Execute**.  
  
    ```  
    -- deletes the proxy "Catalog application proxy"  
    USE msdb ;  
    GO  
    EXEC dbo.sp_delete_proxy  
        @proxy_name = N'Catalog application proxy' ;  
    GO  
    ```
