# Clear Query Results (Visual Database Tools)
After running a query in the **Query and View Designer**, you can clear the Results pane. This procedure applies to queries created by using the **Open View** or **Open Table** options from Object Explorer. In[!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../content/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)], after running a query in the Query Editor, the Results pane cannot be cleared except by closing the Query Editor window or running another query.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> This will not undo the changes you've made to the database. For more information about how the Results pane works see [Work with Data in the Results Pane &#40;Visual Database Tools&#41;](../content/Work-with-Data-in-the-Results-Pane--Visual-Database-Tools-.md).  
  
### To clear query results of a view  
  
-   Right\-click in the [Results pane](../content/Results-Pane--Visual-Database-Tools-.md), point to **Pane**, and then click **Clear Results**.  
  
    If a query is being executed when you clear the Results pane, the Query and View Designer stops the query.
