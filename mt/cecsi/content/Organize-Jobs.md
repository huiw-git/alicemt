# Organize Jobs
Job categories help you organize your jobs for easy filtering and grouping. For example, you can organize all your database backup jobs in the Database Maintenance category. You can also create your own job categories.  
  
> [!WARNING]  
> Multiserver categories exist only on a master server. There is only one default job category available on a master server: \[**Uncategorized (Multi\-Server)**]. When a multiserver job is downloaded, its category is changed to **Jobs From MSX** at the target server.
