## Procedure for Using the SSMA Console  
After the console is successfully launched on your Windows system, you could use the following steps to work on it:

2.  [Generate Reports](assetId:///19278f6a-6d58-4867-9d71-c6228040466e) to view the detailed xml output reports for assessment \/conversion and data migration. Detailed error reports can also be generated for refresh and synchronization commands.  
  
## SSMA Console Output Conventions  
Upon executing the SSMA script commands and options, the console program displays the results and messages (information, error, etc.) to the user on the console or if required, redirects to an xml output file. Each type of message in the output is signified by a unique color. For example, the text message in white color denotes script file commands; the one in green color represents a prompt for user\-input, and so on.
