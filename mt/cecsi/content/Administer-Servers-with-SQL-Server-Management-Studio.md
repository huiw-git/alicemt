# Administer Servers with SQL Server Management Studio
[!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../content/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] is a rich, integrated administrative client designed to meet the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] and Azure SQL Database administrator's server management requirements. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../content/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)], administrative tasks are accomplished using Object Explorer, which allows you to connect to any server in the [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] family and graphically browse its contents. A server can be an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../content/includes/ssDE_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../content/includes/ssASnoversion_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssRSnoversion](../content/includes/ssRSnoversion_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../content/includes/ssISnoversion_md.md)] or Azure SQL Database.  
  
The tool components of [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../content/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] include Registered Servers, Object Explorer, Solution Explorer, Template Explorer, the Object Explorer Details page, and the document window. To display a tool, on the **View** menu, click the tool name. To display the Query Editor tool, click the **New Query** button on the toolbar.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Network traffic between [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../content/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] is unencrypted by default. Do not work with sensitive data (including passwords) in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudio](../content/includes/ssManStudio_md.md)] unless you have established an encrypted connection. For more information, see [How to: Enable Encrypted Connections to the Database Engine (SQL Server Configuration Manager)](assetId:///e1e55519-97ec-4404-81ef-881da3b42006).

-   Register servers.  
  
-   Connect to an instance of the [!INCLUDE[ssDE](../content/includes/ssDE_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssAS](../content/includes/ssAS_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[ssRS](../content/includes/ssRS_md.md)],  [!INCLUDE[ssIS](../content/includes/ssIS_md.md)] or Azure SQL Database.  
  
-   Configure server properties.  
  
-   Manage database and [!INCLUDE[ssAS](../content/includes/ssAS_md.md)] objects such as cubes, dimensions, and assemblies.
