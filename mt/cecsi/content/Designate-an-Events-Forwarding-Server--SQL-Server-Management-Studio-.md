# Designate an Events Forwarding Server (SQL Server Management Studio)
This topic describes how to designate a server to which [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../content/includes/msCoName_md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] forwards events in [!INCLUDE[ssCurrent](../content/includes/ssCurrent_md.md)] by using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../content/includes/ssManStudioFull_md.md)] . Note that event forwarding applies to events forwarded between servers, not to events forwarded between instances of [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../content/includes/ssNoVersion_md.md)] hosted on a single computer. Also note that in order to receive forwarded events, the alerts management server must be a default instance of SQL Server.
