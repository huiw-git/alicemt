# Calculations (Cube Designer) (Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data)
  Use the **Calculations** tab in Cube Designer to view and edit calculations, including calculated members, named sets, and Multidimensional Expressions \(MDX\) script commands for the selected cube.  
  
## Form View and Script View  
 The **Calculations** tab supports two different views when viewing or editing calculations:  
  
-   Form view  
  
     This view displays an organized view of the calculated members, named sets, and script commands contained in the MDX script associated with the cube and provides form editors to view and edit calculated members and named sets, as well as displaying the metadata, functions, and tools available to the cube.  
  
-   Script view  
  
     For advanced users, this view displays the entire MDX script associated with the cube, as well as displaying the metadata, functions, and tools available to the cube.  
  
## Panes  
 **Toolbar**  
 Use the toolbar in both form view and script view to perform common operations on this tab. For more information about this pane, see [Toolbar &#40;Calculations Tab, Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Toolbar--Calculations-Tab,-Cube-Designer---Analysis-Services---Multidimensional-Data-.md).  
  
 **Script Organizer**  
 Use the **Script Organizer** pane in form view to display the contents of the cube script in an ordered format. For more information about this pane, see [Script Organizer &#40;Calculations Tab, Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Script-Organizer--Calculations-Tab,-Cube-Designer---Analysis-Services---Multidimensional-Data-.md).  
  
 **Calculation Tools**  
 Use the **Calculation Tools** pane in both form view and script view to display metadata, functions, and tools available to the cube. For more information about this pane, see [Calculation Tools &#40;Calculations Tab, Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Calculation-Tools--Calculations-Tab,-Cube-Designer---Analysis-Services---Multidimensional-Data-.md).  
  
 **Script Editor**  
 Use the **Script Editor** pane in script view to edit the entire cube script and in form view to edit script commands contained in the cube script. For more information about this pane, see [Script Editor &#40;Calculations Tab, Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Script-Editor--Calculations-Tab,-Cube-Designer---Analysis-Services---Multidimensional-Data-.md).  
  
 **Calculated Member Form Editor**  
 Use the **Calculated Member Form Editor** pane in form view to edit calculated members in the cube script. For more information about this pane, see [Calculated Member Form Editor &#40;Calculations Tab, Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Calculated-Member-Form-Editor--Calculations-Tab,-Cube-Designer---Analysis-Services---Multidimensional-Data-.md).  
  
 **Named Set Form Editor**  
 Use the **Named Set Form Editor** pane in form view to edit named sets in the cube script. For more information about this pane, see [Named Set Form Editor &#40;Calculations Tab, Cube Designer&#41; &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../../Topics/TopicNameNotContainA/Named-Set-Form-Editor--Calculations-Tab,-Cube-Designer---Analysis-Services---Multidimensional-Data-.md).
